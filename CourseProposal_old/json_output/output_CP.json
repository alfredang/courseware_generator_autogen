This report is designed for Singaporeans as a resource for an individual\u2019s skills development journey over the next one to three years.  Singapore\u2019s key growth areas (Digital, Green & Care Economy) bring exciting job and skills opportunities. It also introduced the idea of \u2018priority skills, ' highly transferable skills across job roles within the three economies. In other words, these skills are applicable in many job roles and will contribute significantly to the individual\u2019s long-term career versatility. A new dimension on skills demands growth has been added and analysed alongside skills transferability. Demand growth captures the relative scale of the increase in demand for that skill, while transferability captures the scope of the skill\u2019s applicability across different job roles. The two-dimensional analysis seeks to provide deeper insights to the reader into the nature of the priority skills identified. \n\n#Placeholder[0]"
