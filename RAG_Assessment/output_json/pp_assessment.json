  "scenario": "You are a DevOps Engineer at \"Innovate Solutions,\" a software company specializing in developing mobile applications. Your team is preparing for a major release of the \"ConnectNow\" app, which allows users to manage their social media accounts. The release involves updates across iOS and Android platforms. The project manager has flagged concerns about past release processes, citing frequent configuration errors, deployment delays, and communication issues with stakeholders, including QA and Marketing teams. You have been tasked with ensuring a smooth and efficient release. Using GitHub, you must analyze the release components, coordinate the release schedule with the project manager and QA team, select and execute the appropriate Git scripts for integration and deployment to the different platforms, configure the app for both iOS and Android, run platform-specific configuration tests, diagnose any resulting issues by interpreting test results, and propose and implement necessary modifications to the configurations, deployment processes, or code to resolve them. Finally, you are to document all the steps taken and rationale behind your decisions in a post-mortem report. You are a DevOps Engineer.",
