We found that understanding this information was fundamentally important to appreciating how useful and powerful Git is, but others have argued to us that it can be confusing and unnecessarily complex for beginners. Thus, we\u2019ve made this discussion the last chapter in the book so you could read it early or later in your learning process. We leave it up to you to decide.\n\nNow that you\u2019re here, let\u2019s get started. First, if it isn\u2019t yet clear, Git is fundamentally a content-addressable filesystem with a VCS user interface written on top of it. You\u2019ll learn more about what this means in a bit.\n\nIn the early days of Git (mostly pre 1.5), the user interface was much more complex because it emphasized this filesystem rather than a polished VCS. In the last few years, the UI has been refined until it\u2019s as clean and easy to use as any system out there; however, the stereotype lingers about the early Git UI that was complex and difficult to learn.\n\nThe content-addressable filesystem layer is amazingly cool, so we\u2019ll cover that first in this chapter; then, you\u2019ll learn about the transport mechanisms and the repository maintenance tasks that you may eventually have to deal with.\n\n# Plumbing and Porcelain\n\nThis book covers primarily how to use Git with 30 or so subcommands such as checkout, branch, remote, and so on. But because Git was initially a toolkit for a version control system rather than a full user-friendly VCS, it has a number of subcommands that do low-level work and were designed to be chained together UNIX-style or called from scripts. These commands are generally referred to as Git\u2019s \u201cplumbing\u201d commands, while the more user-friendly commands are called \u201cporcelain\u201d commands.\n\nAs you will have noticed by now, this book\u2019s first nine chapters deal almost exclusively with porcelain commands. But in this chapter, you\u2019ll be dealing mostly with the lower-level plumbing commands, because they give you access to the inner workings of Git, and help demonstrate how and why Git does what it does. Many of these commands aren\u2019t meant to be used manually on the command line, but rather to be used as building blocks for new tools and custom scripts.\n\nWhen you run git init in a new or existing directory, Git creates the .git directory, which is where almost everything that Git stores and manipulates is located. If you want to back up or clone your repository, copying this single directory elsewhere gives you nearly everything you need. This entire chapter basically deals with what you can see in this directory. Here\u2019s what a newly-initialized .git directory typically looks like:\n\n$ ls -F1\nconfig\ndescription\nHEAD",

Here is a quick summary of the ten chapters and three appendices of this book.\n\n# Chapter 1\n\nIn Chapter 1, we\u2019re going to cover Version Control Systems (VCSs) and Git basics \u2014 no technical stuff, just what Git is, why it came about in a land full of VCSs, what sets it apart, and why so many people are using it. Then, we\u2019ll explain how to download Git and set it up for the first time if you don\u2019t already have it on your system.\n\n# Chapter 2\n\nIn Chapter 2, we will go over basic Git usage \u2014 how to use Git in the 80% of cases you\u2019ll encounter most often. After reading this chapter, you should be able to clone a repository, see what has happened in the history of the project, modify files, and contribute changes. If the book spontaneously combusts at this point, you should already be pretty useful wielding Git in the time it takes you to go pick up another copy.\n\n# Chapter 3\n\nChapter 3 is about the branching model in Git, often described as Git\u2019s killer feature. Here you\u2019ll learn what truly sets Git apart from the pack. When you\u2019re done, you may feel the need to spend a quiet moment pondering how you lived before Git branching was part of your life.\n\n# Chapter 4\n\nChapter 4 will cover Git on the server. This chapter is for those of you who want to set up Git inside your organization or on your own personal server for collaboration. We will also explore various hosted options if you prefer to let someone else handle that for you.\n\n# Chapter 5\n\nChapter 5 will go over in full detail various distributed workflows and how to accomplish them with Git. When you are done with this chapter, you should be able to work expertly with multiple remote repositories, use Git over email and deftly juggle numerous remote branches and contributed patches.\n\n# Chapter 6\n\nChapter 6 covers the GitHub hosting service and tooling in depth. We cover signing up for and managing an account, creating and using Git repositories, common workflows to contribute to projects and to accept contributions to yours, GitHub\u2019s programmatic interface and lots of little tips to make your life easier in general.\n\n# Chapter 7\n\nChapter 7 is about advanced Git commands. Here you will learn about topics like mastering the scary 'reset' command, using binary search to identify bugs, editing history, revision selection in detail, and a lot more. This chapter will round out your knowledge of Git so that you are truly a master.\n\n# Chapter 8\n\nChapter 8 is about configuring your custom Git environment. This includes setting up hook scripts to enforce or encourage customized policies and using environment configuration settings so you can work the way you want to. We will also cover building your own set of scripts to enforce a custom committing policy.\n\n# Chapter 9\n\nChapter 9 deals with Git and other VCSs. This includes using Git in a Subversion (SVN) world and converting projects from other VCSs to Git. A lot of organizations still use SVN and are not about to change, but by this point you\u2019ll have learned the incredible power of Git \u2014 and this chapter shows you how to cope if you still have to use a SVN server.

We found that understanding this information was fundamentally important to appreciating how useful and powerful Git is, but others have argued to us that it can be confusing and unnecessarily complex for beginners. Thus, we\u2019ve made this discussion the last chapter in the book so you could read it early or later in your learning process. We leave it up to you to decide.\n\nNow that you\u2019re here, let\u2019s get started. First, if it isn\u2019t yet clear, Git is fundamentally a content-addressable filesystem with a VCS user interface written on top of it. You\u2019ll learn more about what this means in a bit.\n\nIn the early days of Git (mostly pre 1.5), the user interface was much more complex because it emphasized this filesystem rather than a polished VCS. In the last few years, the UI has been refined until it\u2019s as clean and easy to use as any system out there; however, the stereotype lingers about the early Git UI that was complex and difficult to learn.\n\nThe content-addressable filesystem layer is amazingly cool, so we\u2019ll cover that first in this chapter; then, you\u2019ll learn about the transport mechanisms and the repository maintenance tasks that you may eventually have to deal with.\n\n# Plumbing and Porcelain\n\nThis book covers primarily how to use Git with 30 or so subcommands such as checkout, branch, remote, and so on. But because Git was initially a toolkit for a version control system rather than a full user-friendly VCS, it has a number of subcommands that do low-level work and were designed to be chained together UNIX-style or called from scripts. These commands are generally referred to as Git\u2019s \u201cplumbing\u201d commands, while the more user-friendly commands are called \u201cporcelain\u201d commands.\n\nAs you will have noticed by now, this book\u2019s first nine chapters deal almost exclusively with porcelain commands. But in this chapter, you\u2019ll be dealing mostly with the lower-level plumbing commands, because they give you access to the inner workings of Git, and help demonstrate how and why Git does what it does. Many of these commands aren\u2019t meant to be used manually on the command line, but rather to be used as building blocks for new tools and custom scripts.\n\nWhen you run git init in a new or existing directory, Git creates the .git directory, which is where almost everything that Git stores and manipulates is located. If you want to back up or clone your repository, copying this single directory elsewhere gives you nearly everything you need. This entire chapter basically deals with what you can see in this directory. Here\u2019s what a newly-initialized .git directory typically looks like:\n\n$ ls -F1\nconfig\ndescription\nHEAD",
