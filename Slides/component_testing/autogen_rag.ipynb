      "just a few years.\n",

      "available for a use case. Then, match this with a machine learning approach (an algorithm \n",
      "and a metric) as shown in Figure 1.1. We will look at how to fit the ML project into the \n",
      "budget and timeline.\n",
      "Now, imagine you are being tasked with using ML to solve a problem. You first need to \n",
      "identify the use case and fit it to a machine learning problem.\n",
      "For example, say you are trying to predict house prices, you can use a regression model. \n",
      "The performance requirements of the model will be determined by the business.\n",
      "Say, you have had a discussion with the key people and understood the use case; you now \n",
      "need to identify the key stakeholders, the people related to the use case. The stakeholders \n",
      "can be executives, the CFO, data engineers, tech support staff who may have to approve the \n",
      "project to proceed. Each of these stakeholders might have very different expectations of this \n",
      "ML project, and your ability to communicate the value could make the difference between \n",
      "approval or rejection. Executives are looking for impact to business, CFOs are typically \n",
      "interested in the budget of the solution, managers might be keen on timelines, and data man-\n",

      "For example, say your company has a learning management system (LMS), a platform \n",
      "where students subscribe to courses. You have data of students’ activities and using this you \n",
      "want to improve the experience using machine learning. You could do several things:\n",
      " ■Create a recommendation engine to show new courses for students.\n",
      " ■Churn prediction to see if a student is going to quit the course.\n",
      " ■Churn prediction to see if a teacher is not going to come back.\n",
      " ■Identify what makes a course interesting for students (sample questions, more images, \n",
      "more tables, short videos, etc.).\n",
      " ■Identify what kind of learning a student prefers (auditory, visual, or kinesthetic).\n",
      "Which of these would be most impactful is a question that can be answered only by the \n",
      "business owner.\n",
      "Once you have identified the use case with the highest impact on your business, you need \n",
      "to identify the outcome of your machine learning solution. In short, what would happen if \n",
      "you implemented your solution? Sometimes, your model would make accurate predictions, \n",
      "but the environment might react in a counterproductive way to these predictions. This is \n",
      "because the environment is seldom static; the users could adapt or the users could get con-\n",
      "fused with the behavior of the predictions.\n",
      "For example, say your company has a video sharing website, and you have millions of \n",
      "videos. You are trying to build an ML model to recommend videos to your users. You could \n",
      "choose from among the following:\n",
      " ■An ML model to recommend unseen videos from popular video creators. The problem is \n",
      "that this is not personalized. What if the user does not like some of the creators?\n",
      " ■An ML model to recommend videos that get a lot of clicks. But what if these are just \n",
      "clickbait, where people click and regret wasting time?\n",
      " ■An ML model to recommend videos that have been watched fully by similar users. This \n",
      "would lead to improving the user experience.\n",
      "In this example, you need to have a good understanding of the use case, the overall goal, \n",
      "and the end user to be able to find the right fit.\n",
      "Next, find out if the problem is even solvable using machine learning. Business leaders \n",
      "hear inspiring stories in the media about how a business solves a problem with ML and it \n",
      "sounds magical and the business leaders would love to use it to solve their business prob-\n",
      "lems. They need an expert like you to figure out if it is even feasible to solve their problem \n",
      "using ML. This is not as easy as it sounds; it depends on several things, like existing tech-\n",
      "nology, available data, and budget. For example, natural language processing has advanced \n",
      "leaps and bounds and has made it possible to do things that were impossible just a few years \n",
      "ago, such as using ML to answer a question from a piece of text. Familiarity with the lat-\n",
      "est advancements in natural language processing would help you identify easier, faster, and \n",
      "better ML methods to solve your business problems.\n",
      "As the next step, you will need to identify an ML learning approach that fits your \n",
      "use case.\n",

      "Machine Learning Approaches\n",
      "Many machine learning problems have been well researched and have elegant solutions, but \n",
      "some algorithms are not perfect and some problems can be solved in multiple ways. Some-\n",
      "times, a use case will fit perfectly with an ML framework and other times not so well. You \n",
      "need to be aware of the landscape of ML problems. There are several approaches to machine \n",
      "learning methods. Some of these approaches have been studied for decades, and others are \n",
      "fairly new. There are hundreds if not thousands of ways to apply machine learning tech-\n",
      "niques. To help us get a grasp of the breadth of these methods, we organize them into cate-\n",
      "gories (also called methods, or types or approaches or problems). Each of these approaches \n",
      "solves a specific class of problems, distinguished by the type of data, the type of prediction, \n",
      "and so on.\n",
      "On the exam, you will be given the details of a use case and will be \n",
      "expected to understand the nature of the problem and find the appro -\n",
      "priate machine learning approach to solve it. To accomplish that, you \n",
      "need to have wide knowledge of the landscape of these machine learning \n",
      "approaches.\n",
      "We will look at the different ways to classify the approaches in the following sections.\n",
      "Supervised, Unsupervised, and Semi- supervised  \n",
      "Learning\n",
      "A common method of classifying machine learning approaches is based on the type of \n",
      "learning. When you have a labeled dataset that you can use to train your model, it is called \n",
      "supervised learning. For example, supervised learning would be trying to build a model to \n",
      "classify images of dogs or cats and having the ability to use a dataset of images that have \n",
      "been labeled accordingly.\n",
      "There are some cases where you have only unlabeled data, such as a set of images \n",
      "(without any labels or tags), and you will be asked to classify or group them. This would be \n",
      "an unsupervised ML model. Clustering algorithms are a suite of algorithms that belong to \n",
      "this type and are used to group and/or classify data. Autoencoders are also a family of algo-\n",
      "rithms that belong to this type. Autoencoders are used to reduce the dimensionality of input \n",
      "data, a preprocessing step in many machine learning models.\n",
      "Another popular unsupervised ML use case is topic modeling, a type of document clus-\n",
      "tering problem. The algorithm takes documents and classifies them into N number of classes \n",
      "based on the commonality of words and sentences in the texts. Comparing this to how \n",
      "a human being would classify books, say, in a library, you may classify them into fiction, \n",
      "nonfiction, science, history, and so on. In other times, you may classify the books based on \n",
      "languages (for example, English, Chinese, Hindi). Similarly, an unsupervised algorithm may \n",
      "or may not classify in the way you expected. The output of unsupervised learning methods \n",

      "To solve the problem of uncertainty in unsupervised learning, there is a hybrid solution \n",
      "called semi- supervised learning, where some data is labeled and other data is not. This is \n",
      "like guiding the algorithm toward the clusters that you want to see. While semi- supervised \n",
      "models are interesting research topics and have some utility, in a majority of use cases, super -\n",
      "vised models are used.\n",
      "There are many other kinds of machine learning models beyond these, including rein-\n",
      "forcement learning (where the algorithm is not given data but is given an environment that \n",
      "the agent explores and learns) and active learning algorithm, but they are beyond the scope \n",
      "of the certificate exam.\n",
      "Another way to classify the machine learning algorithms is based on the type of pre-\n",
      "diction. The type of data the model will predict determines several aspects of the machine \n",
      "learning algorithm and the method used. We will explore that next.\n",
      "Classification, Regression, Forecasting, and Clustering\n",
      "Classification is the process of predicting the “labels” or “classes” or “categories.” Given a \n",
      "picture of a pet, classifying dogs versus cats is a classification problem. If there are just two \n",
      "labels, it is called binary classification, and if there are more labels, it is called multiclass \n",
      "classification. You could have a classification with thousands of labels; for example, the \n",
      "Cloud Vision API can classify millions of different objects in a picture, which is a more diffi-\n",
      "cult problem to solve. You cannot apply the same model for binary classification, multiclass \n",
      "classification, and classification with thousands of classes.\n",
      "In regression, the ML model predicts a number— for example, prediction of house price \n",
      "(given the number of bedrooms, square footage, zip code), prediction of the amount of rain-\n",
      "fall (given temperature, humidity, location). Here the predicted value’s range depends on the \n",
      "use case. The ML algorithms used for regression are usually different from classification. \n",
      "Typically, you would find structured data (data in rows and columns), as shown in Table 1.2, \n",
      "being used for regression problems.\n",

      "Forecasting is another type where the input is time-series data and the model predicts \n",
      "the future values. In a time-series dataset (Table 1.3), you get a series of input values that \n",
      "are indexed in time order. For example, you have a series of temperature measurements \n",
      "taken every hour for 10 hours from a sensor. In this case, one temperature reading is related \n",
      "to the previous and next reading because they are from the same sensor, in subsequent \n",
      "hours, and usually only vary to a small extent by the hour, so they are not considered to be \n",
      "“independent” (an important distinction from other types of structured data).\n",
      "Some forecasting problems can be converted to regression problems by modifying the \n",
      "time-series data into independent and identically distributed (IID) values. This is done either \n",
      "for convenience or availability of data or for preference for a certain type of ML model. In \n",
      "other cases, regression problems can be converted into classification problems by bucketiz-\n",
      "ing the values. We will look into details in the following chapters. There is an art to fitting an \n",
      "ML model to a use case.\n",
      "Clustering is another type of problem, where the algorithm creates groups in the data \n",
      "based on inherent similarities and differences among the different data points. For example, \n",
      "if we are given the latitude and longitude of every house on Earth, the algorithm might \n",

      "For example, say you are trying to predict house prices, you can use a regression model. \n",

      "For example, say your company has a learning management system (LMS), a platform \n",
      "where students subscribe to courses. You have data of students’ activities and using this you \n",
      "want to improve the experience using machine learning. You could do several things:\n",
      " ■Create a recommendation engine to show new courses for students.\n",
      " ■Churn prediction to see if a student is going to quit the course.\n",
      " ■Churn prediction to see if a teacher is not going to come back.\n",
      " ■Identify what makes a course interesting for students (sample questions, more images, \n",
      "more tables, short videos, etc.).\n",
      " ■Identify what kind of learning a student prefers (auditory, visual, or kinesthetic).\n",
      "Which of these would be most impactful is a question that can be answered only by the \n",
      "business owner.\n",
      "Once you have identified the use case with the highest impact on your business, you need \n",
      "to identify the outcome of your machine learning solution. In short, what would happen if \n",
      "you implemented your solution? Sometimes, your model would make accurate predictions, \n",
      "but the environment might react in a counterproductive way to these predictions. This is \n",
      "because the environment is seldom static; the users could adapt or the users could get con-\n",
      "fused with the behavior of the predictions.\n",
      "For example, say your company has a video sharing website, and you have millions of \n",
      "videos. You are trying to build an ML model to recommend videos to your users. You could \n",
      "choose from among the following:\n",
      " ■An ML model to recommend unseen videos from popular video creators. The problem is \n",
      "that this is not personalized. What if the user does not like some of the creators?\n",
      " ■An ML model to recommend videos that get a lot of clicks. But what if these are just \n",
      "clickbait, where people click and regret wasting time?\n",
      " ■An ML model to recommend videos that have been watched fully by similar users. This \n",
      "would lead to improving the user experience.\n",
      "In this example, you need to have a good understanding of the use case, the overall goal, \n",
      "and the end user to be able to find the right fit.\n",
      "Next, find out if the problem is even solvable using machine learning. Business leaders \n",
      "hear inspiring stories in the media about how a business solves a problem with ML and it \n",
      "sounds magical and the business leaders would love to use it to solve their business prob-\n",
      "lems. They need an expert like you to figure out if it is even feasible to solve their problem \n",
      "using ML. This is not as easy as it sounds; it depends on several things, like existing tech-\n",
      "nology, available data, and budget. For example, natural language processing has advanced \n",
      "leaps and bounds and has made it possible to do things that were impossible just a few years \n",
      "ago, such as using ML to answer a question from a piece of text. Familiarity with the lat-\n",

      "Supervised, Unsupervised, and Semi- supervised  \n",
      "Learning\n",
      "A common method of classifying machine learning approaches is based on the type of \n",
      "learning. When you have a labeled dataset that you can use to train your model, it is called \n",
      "supervised learning. For example, supervised learning would be trying to build a model to \n",
      "classify images of dogs or cats and having the ability to use a dataset of images that have \n",
      "been labeled accordingly.\n",
      "There are some cases where you have only unlabeled data, such as a set of images \n",
      "(without any labels or tags), and you will be asked to classify or group them. This would be \n",
      "an unsupervised ML model. Clustering algorithms are a suite of algorithms that belong to \n",
      "this type and are used to group and/or classify data. Autoencoders are also a family of algo-\n",
      "rithms that belong to this type. Autoencoders are used to reduce the dimensionality of input \n",
      "data, a preprocessing step in many machine learning models.\n",
      "Another popular unsupervised ML use case is topic modeling, a type of document clus-\n",
      "tering problem. The algorithm takes documents and classifies them into N number of classes \n",
      "based on the commonality of words and sentences in the texts. Comparing this to how \n",
      "a human being would classify books, say, in a library, you may classify them into fiction, \n",
      "nonfiction, science, history, and so on. In other times, you may classify the books based on \n",

      "To solve the problem of uncertainty in unsupervised learning, there is a hybrid solution \n",
      "called semi- supervised learning, where some data is labeled and other data is not. This is \n",
      "like guiding the algorithm toward the clusters that you want to see. While semi- supervised \n",
      "models are interesting research topics and have some utility, in a majority of use cases, super -\n",
      "vised models are used.\n",
      "There are many other kinds of machine learning models beyond these, including rein-\n",

      "the agent explores and learns) and active learning algorithm, but they are beyond the scope \n",
      "of the certificate exam.\n",
      "Another way to classify the machine learning algorithms is based on the type of pre-\n",
      "diction. The type of data the model will predict determines several aspects of the machine \n",
      "learning algorithm and the method used. We will explore that next.\n",
      "Classification, Regression, Forecasting, and Clustering\n",
      "Classification is the process of predicting the “labels” or “classes” or “categories.” Given a \n",
      "picture of a pet, classifying dogs versus cats is a classification problem. If there are just two \n",
      "labels, it is called binary classification, and if there are more labels, it is called multiclass \n",
      "classification. You could have a classification with thousands of labels; for example, the \n",
      "Cloud Vision API can classify millions of different objects in a picture, which is a more diffi-\n",
      "cult problem to solve. You cannot apply the same model for binary classification, multiclass \n",
      "classification, and classification with thousands of classes.\n",
      "In regression, the ML model predicts a number— for example, prediction of house price \n",
      "(given the number of bedrooms, square footage, zip code), prediction of the amount of rain-\n",
      "fall (given temperature, humidity, location). Here the predicted value’s range depends on the \n",

      "Forecasting is another type where the input is time-series data and the model predicts \n",
      "the future values. In a time-series dataset (Table 1.3), you get a series of input values that \n",
      "are indexed in time order. For example, you have a series of temperature measurements \n",
      "taken every hour for 10 hours from a sensor. In this case, one temperature reading is related \n",
      "to the previous and next reading because they are from the same sensor, in subsequent \n",
      "hours, and usually only vary to a small extent by the hour, so they are not considered to be \n",
      "“independent” (an important distinction from other types of structured data).\n",
      "Some forecasting problems can be converted to regression problems by modifying the \n",
      "time-series data into independent and identically distributed (IID) values. This is done either \n",
      "for convenience or availability of data or for preference for a certain type of ML model. In \n",

      "This is the same value generated by someone who is 30 years old, doesn’t smoke, and weighs \n",

      "To solve the problem of uncertainty in unsupervised learning, there is a hybrid solution \n",
      "called semi- supervised learning, where some data is labeled and other data is not. This is \n",
      "like guiding the algorithm toward the clusters that you want to see. While semi- supervised \n",
      "models are interesting research topics and have some utility, in a majority of use cases, super -\n",
      "vised models are used.\n",
      "There are many other kinds of machine learning models beyond these, including rein-\n",
      "forcement learning (where the algorithm is not given data but is given an environment that \n",
      "the agent explores and learns) and active learning algorithm, but they are beyond the scope \n",
      "of the certificate exam.\n",
      "Another way to classify the machine learning algorithms is based on the type of pre-\n",

      "Classification, Regression, Forecasting, and Clustering\n",
      "Classification is the process of predicting the “labels” or “classes” or “categories.” Given a \n",
      "picture of a pet, classifying dogs versus cats is a classification problem. If there are just two \n",
      "labels, it is called binary classification, and if there are more labels, it is called multiclass \n",
      "classification. You could have a classification with thousands of labels; for example, the \n",

      "cult problem to solve. You cannot apply the same model for binary classification, multiclass \n",
      "classification, and classification with thousands of classes.\n",
      "In regression, the ML model predicts a number— for example, prediction of house price \n",
      "(given the number of bedrooms, square footage, zip code), prediction of the amount of rain-\n",
      "fall (given temperature, humidity, location). Here the predicted value’s range depends on the \n",

      "Forecasting is another type where the input is time-series data and the model predicts \n",
      "the future values. In a time-series dataset (Table 1.3), you get a series of input values that \n",
      "are indexed in time order. For example, you have a series of temperature measurements \n",
      "taken every hour for 10 hours from a sensor. In this case, one temperature reading is related \n",
      "to the previous and next reading because they are from the same sensor, in subsequent \n",
      "hours, and usually only vary to a small extent by the hour, so they are not considered to be \n",
      "“independent” (an important distinction from other types of structured data).\n",
      "Some forecasting problems can be converted to regression problems by modifying the \n",

      "For example, say your company has a learning management system (LMS), a platform \n",

      " ■Churn prediction to see if a teacher is not going to come back.\n",

      "more tables, short videos, etc.).\n",
      " ■Identify what kind of learning a student prefers (auditory, visual, or kinesthetic).\n",
      "Which of these would be most impactful is a question that can be answered only by the \n",
      "business owner.\n",
      "Once you have identified the use case with the highest impact on your business, you need \n",
      "to identify the outcome of your machine learning solution. In short, what would happen if \n",
      "you implemented your solution? Sometimes, your model would make accurate predictions, \n",
      "but the environment might react in a counterproductive way to these predictions. This is \n",
      "because the environment is seldom static; the users could adapt or the users could get con-\n",
      "fused with the behavior of the predictions.\n",
      "For example, say your company has a video sharing website, and you have millions of \n",
      "videos. You are trying to build an ML model to recommend videos to your users. You could \n",
      "choose from among the following:\n",
      " ■An ML model to recommend unseen videos from popular video creators. The problem is \n",
      "that this is not personalized. What if the user does not like some of the creators?\n",
      " ■An ML model to recommend videos that get a lot of clicks. But what if these are just \n",
      "clickbait, where people click and regret wasting time?\n",
      " ■An ML model to recommend videos that have been watched fully by similar users. This \n",
      "would lead to improving the user experience.\n",
      "In this example, you need to have a good understanding of the use case, the overall goal, \n",
      "and the end user to be able to find the right fit.\n",
      "Next, find out if the problem is even solvable using machine learning. Business leaders \n",
      "hear inspiring stories in the media about how a business solves a problem with ML and it \n",
      "sounds magical and the business leaders would love to use it to solve their business prob-\n",
      "lems. They need an expert like you to figure out if it is even feasible to solve their problem \n",
      "using ML. This is not as easy as it sounds; it depends on several things, like existing tech-\n",
      "nology, available data, and budget. For example, natural language processing has advanced \n",
      "leaps and bounds and has made it possible to do things that were impossible just a few years \n",

      "ROC stands for receiver operating characteristic curve (it comes from the field of \n",

      "classification model (Figure 1.2). The x- axis is the false positive rate, and the y- axis is the \n",
      "true positive rate, and the plot is generated at different classification thresholds. The ideal \n",
      "point for this plot is the top- left corner, which has 100 percent true positive and 0 percent \n",
      "false positive, but in practice you will never see this. You can also calculate the precision, \n",
      "recall, and F1 at each point on the curve. When you visually inspect the curve, a diagonal \n",
      "line is the worst case, and we want the curve to stretch as far from the diagonal as possible.\n",
      "When you have two models, you get two ROC curves, and the way to compare them is to \n",
      "calculate the area under the curve (AUC).\n",
      "Once you have chosen the model based on AUC, you can find the threshold point that \n",
      "maximizes your F1 (as indicated in Figure 1.2).\n",
      "This method has the following advantages:\n",
      " ■Scale- invariant: It measures how well the predictions are ranked and not their abso-\n",

      " ■Classification threshold-invariant: It helps you measure the model irrespective of what \n",

      "Classi fication threshold invariance is not always desirable because some -\n",

      "Supervised, Unsupervised, and Semi- supervised  \n",
      "Learning\n",
      "A common method of classifying machine learning approaches is based on the type of \n",
      "learning. When you have a labeled dataset that you can use to train your model, it is called \n",
      "supervised learning. For example, supervised learning would be trying to build a model to \n",
      "classify images of dogs or cats and having the ability to use a dataset of images that have \n",
      "been labeled accordingly.\n",
      "There are some cases where you have only unlabeled data, such as a set of images \n",
      "(without any labels or tags), and you will be asked to classify or group them. This would be \n",
      "an unsupervised ML model. Clustering algorithms are a suite of algorithms that belong to \n",
      "this type and are used to group and/or classify data. Autoencoders are also a family of algo-\n",
      "rithms that belong to this type. Autoencoders are used to reduce the dimensionality of input \n",
      "data, a preprocessing step in many machine learning models.\n",
      "Another popular unsupervised ML use case is topic modeling, a type of document clus-\n",
      "tering problem. The algorithm takes documents and classifies them into N number of classes \n",
      "based on the commonality of words and sentences in the texts. Comparing this to how \n",
      "a human being would classify books, say, in a library, you may classify them into fiction, \n",
      "nonfiction, science, history, and so on. In other times, you may classify the books based on \n",

      "Classification, Regression, Forecasting, and Clustering\n",
      "Classification is the process of predicting the “labels” or “classes” or “categories.” Given a \n",

      "Forecasting is another type where the input is time-series data and the model predicts \n",
      "the future values. In a time-series dataset (Table 1.3), you get a series of input values that \n",
      "are indexed in time order. For example, you have a series of temperature measurements \n",
      "taken every hour for 10 hours from a sensor. In this case, one temperature reading is related \n",

      "Some forecasting problems can be converted to regression problems by modifying the \n",

      "Scatterplot\n",
      "A scatterplot is the most common plot used in data science and is mostly used to visualize \n",
      "clusters in a dataset and show the relationship between two variables.\n",
      "Statistics Fundamentals\n",
      "In statistics, we have three measures of central tendency: mean, median, and mode. They \n",
      "help us describe the data and can be used to clean data statistically.\n",
      "Mean\n",
      "Mean is the accurate measure to describe the data when we do not have any outliers present.\n",
      "Median\n",
      "Median is used if there is an outlier in the dataset. You can find the median by arranging \n",
      "data values from the lowest to the highest value.\n",
      "If there are even numbers, the median is the average of two numbers in the middle, and if \n",
      "there are odd numbers, the median is the middle value. For example, in the dataset 1, 1, 2, 4, \n",
      "6, 6, 9, the median is 4. For the dataset 1, 1, 4, 6, 6, 9, the median is 5. Take the mean of 4 \n",
      "and 6, or (4+6) / 2 = 5.\n",

      "Mode\n",
      "Mode is used if there is an outlier and the majority of the data is the same. Mode is the value \n",
      "or values in the dataset that occur most.\n",
      "For example, for the dataset 1, 1, 2, 5, 5, 5, 9, the mode is 5.\n",
      "Outlier Detection\n",
      "Mean is the measure of central tendency that is affected by the outliers, which in turn \n",
      "impacts standard deviation.\n",
      "For example, consider the following small dataset:\n",
      "[15, 18, 7, 13, 16, 11, 21, 5, 15, 10, 9, 210]\n",
      "By looking at it, one can quickly say 210 is an outlier that is much larger than the \n",
      "other values.\n",
      "As you can see from Table 2.1, there has been a significant change in mean by adding an \n",
      "outlier compared to median and mode. Variance is the average of the squared differences \n",
      "from the mean.\n",
      "Standard Deviation\n",
      "Standard deviation is the square root of the variance. Standard deviation is an excellent way \n",
      "to identify outliers. Data points that lie more than one standard deviation from the mean can \n",
      "be considered unusual.\n",
      "Covariance is a measure of how much two random variables vary from \n",
      "each other.\n",

      "of age, smoker (represented as 1 or 0), and body weight, the data might get condensed into a \n",

      "1.5age + 30smoker + 0.2 * body- weight\n",
      "Somebody who is 20 years old, smokes, and weighs 140 pounds generates a value of 88. \n",
      "This is the same value generated by someone who is 30 years old, doesn’t smoke, and weighs \n",
      "215 pounds.\n",
      "This method can be quite robust because even if one identifies individuals who are unique \n",
      "in some way, it is hard to determine without an explanation of the PCA vector formula what \n",

      "You learned in the previous section how to check for data quality. In this section, we will \n",
      "talk about data sampling, imbalanced data, and how to split your dataset. We generally \n",
      "divide the data into training, test, and validation dataset (see Figure 2.6).\n",
      "Training Dataset This is the actual dataset that we use to train the model, and our \n",
      "model learns from this data.\n",
      "Validation Dataset This is a subset of data that is used for the evaluation of the model. \n",
      "This data is used for hyperparameter tuning. The model does not use this data to learn \n",
      "from it, unlike training data. It is used for improving the model behavior after training.\n",
      "Test Dataset This is the sample of data used to test or evaluate the performance of \n",
      "your model. The test set is different from the training and validation sets as it’s used \n",
      "after model training and model validation. The test set should not contain the data \n",
      "samples in the validation or training set because it might cause data leakage. Also, you \n",
      "should never train your data using the test set.\n",
      "Imbalanced Data\n",
      "When two classes in a dataset are not equal, the result is imbalanced data. In the example \n",
      "shown in Figure 2.7, there is less chance of credit card fraud in the dataset compared to \n",
      "No fraud.\n",
      "In the case of credit card transactions, suppose, out of all transactions, 1,000 are not \n",
      "fraud examples and only five are fraud transactions. This is a classic representation of imbal-\n",
      "anced data. In this scenario, we do not have enough transactions to train the model to clas-\n",
      "sify whether a credit card transaction is fraud. The training model will spend more time on  \n",
      "no- fraud scenarios.\n",
      "In a random sampling, you can perform either oversampling, which means duplicating \n",
      "samples from the minority class, or undersampling, which means deleting samples from the \n",
      "majority class. Both of these approaches include bias because they introduce either more \n",
      "samples or fewer samples to remove imbalance.\n",

      "Now let’s upweight the downsampled class. Since we downsampled by a factor of 10, \n",
      "the example weight should be 10. Example weight means counting an individual example \n",
      "as more important during training. An example weight of 10 means the model treats the \n",
      "example as 10 times as important (when computing loss) as it would for an example of \n",
      "weight 1. Refer to https://developers.google.com/machine- learning/data- \n",
      "prep/construct/sampling- splitting/imbalanced- data  to learn more.\n",
      "One of the advantages of downsampling and upweighting the downsampled class is faster \n",
      "model convergence because we have more of the minority class examples compared to the \n",
      "data before downsampling and upweighting.\n",
      "Data Splitting\n",
      "Mostly with general data cleaning, you would start with random splitting of the data. For \n",
      "example, consider datasets having naturally clustered examples.\n",
      "Say you want your model to classify the topics in the text of a book. The topics can be \n",
      "horror, love story, and drama. A random split would be a problem in that case.\n",
      "Why would having a random split cause a skew? It can cause a skew because stories with \n",
      "the same type of topic are written on the same timeline. If the data is split randomly, the test \n",
      "set and training set might contain the same stories.\n",
      "To fix this, try splitting the data based on the time the  story was published. For example, \n",
      "you can put stories written in June in the training set and stories published in July in the \n",
      "test set.\n",
      "Another simple approach to fixing this problem would be to split the data based on when \n",
      "the story was published. For example, you could train on stories for the month of April and \n",
      "then use the second week of May as the test set to prevent overlap.\n",
      "Data Splitting Strategy for Online Systems\n",
      "For online systems, it’s recommended to split the data by time as the training data is older \n",
      "than the serving data. By splitting data by time, you ensure your validation set mirrors the \n",
      "lag of time between training and prediction.\n",
      "Here are the steps:\n",
      "1. Perform data collection for 30 days.\n",
      "2. Create a training set for data from day 1 to day 29.\n",
      "3. Create a validation set for data for day 30.\n",
      "Generally, time- based splits work best with very large datasets, such as, for example, data \n",
      "with millions of examples.\n",
      "When it is clustered data— for example, a book or an online system— you have to make \n",
      "sure that you split the data in a way that your model will not get trained using information \n",
      "not available at prediction time. That’s why you should use a time- based approach rather \n",
      "than a random split. For data splitting, you should always use domain knowledge to under -\n",
      "stand when a random split will work versus when to do a time- based split.\n",

      "Organizing and Optimizing \n",
      "Training Datasets\n",
      "You learned in the previous section how to check for data quality. In this section, we will \n",
      "talk about data sampling, imbalanced data, and how to split your dataset. We generally \n",
      "divide the data into training, test, and validation dataset (see Figure 2.6).\n",
      "Training Dataset This is the actual dataset that we use to train the model, and our \n",
      "model learns from this data.\n",
      "Validation Dataset This is a subset of data that is used for the evaluation of the model. \n",
      "This data is used for hyperparameter tuning. The model does not use this data to learn \n",
      "from it, unlike training data. It is used for improving the model behavior after training.\n",
      "Test Dataset This is the sample of data used to test or evaluate the performance of \n",
      "your model. The test set is different from the training and validation sets as it’s used \n",
      "after model training and model validation. The test set should not contain the data \n",
      "samples in the validation or training set because it might cause data leakage. Also, you \n",
      "should never train your data using the test set.\n",
      "Imbalanced Data\n",
      "When two classes in a dataset are not equal, the result is imbalanced data. In the example \n",
      "shown in Figure 2.7, there is less chance of credit card fraud in the dataset compared to \n",
      "No fraud.\n",
      "In the case of credit card transactions, suppose, out of all transactions, 1,000 are not \n",
      "fraud examples and only five are fraud transactions. This is a classic representation of imbal-\n",
      "anced data. In this scenario, we do not have enough transactions to train the model to clas-\n",
      "sify whether a credit card transaction is fraud. The training model will spend more time on  \n",
      "no- fraud scenarios.\n",
      "In a random sampling, you can perform either oversampling, which means duplicating \n",
      "samples from the minority class, or undersampling, which means deleting samples from the \n",
      "majority class. Both of these approaches include bias because they introduce either more \n",
      "samples or fewer samples to remove imbalance.\n",

      "An effective way to handle imbalanced data is to downsample and \n",

      "Now let’s upweight the downsampled class. Since we downsampled by a factor of 10, \n",
      "the example weight should be 10. Example weight means counting an individual example \n",
      "as more important during training. An example weight of 10 means the model treats the \n",
      "example as 10 times as important (when computing loss) as it would for an example of \n",
      "weight 1. Refer to https://developers.google.com/machine- learning/data- \n",
      "prep/construct/sampling- splitting/imbalanced- data  to learn more.\n",
      "One of the advantages of downsampling and upweighting the downsampled class is faster \n",
      "model convergence because we have more of the minority class examples compared to the \n",
      "data before downsampling and upweighting.\n",
      "Data Splitting\n",
      "Mostly with general data cleaning, you would start with random splitting of the data. For \n",
      "example, consider datasets having naturally clustered examples.\n",
      "Say you want your model to classify the topics in the text of a book. The topics can be \n",
      "horror, love story, and drama. A random split would be a problem in that case.\n",
      "Why would having a random split cause a skew? It can cause a skew because stories with \n",
      "the same type of topic are written on the same timeline. If the data is split randomly, the test \n",
      "set and training set might contain the same stories.\n",
      "To fix this, try splitting the data based on the time the  story was published. For example, \n",
      "you can put stories written in June in the training set and stories published in July in the \n",
      "test set.\n",
      "Another simple approach to fixing this problem would be to split the data based on when \n",
      "the story was published. For example, you could train on stories for the month of April and \n",
      "then use the second week of May as the test set to prevent overlap.\n",
      "Data Splitting Strategy for Online Systems\n",
      "For online systems, it’s recommended to split the data by time as the training data is older \n",
      "than the serving data. By splitting data by time, you ensure your validation set mirrors the \n",
      "lag of time between training and prediction.\n",
      "Here are the steps:\n",
      "1. Perform data collection for 30 days.\n",
      "2. Create a training set for data from day 1 to day 29.\n",
      "3. Create a validation set for data for day 30.\n",
      "Generally, time- based splits work best with very large datasets, such as, for example, data \n",
      "with millions of examples.\n",
      "When it is clustered data— for example, a book or an online system— you have to make \n",
      "sure that you split the data in a way that your model will not get trained using information \n",
      "not available at prediction time. That’s why you should use a time- based approach rather \n",
      "than a random split. For data splitting, you should always use domain knowledge to under -\n",
      "stand when a random split will work versus when to do a time- based split.\n",

      "One of the methods of protecting data with multiple columns is to use an ML algorithm \n",
      "such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or other dimension- reducing techniques to \n",
      "combine several features and then carry out ML training only on the resulting  \n",
      "PCA vectors, according to https://medium.com/lizuna/beacon- the-  \n",
      "use- of- principal- components- analysis- to- mask- sensitive- data-  \n",
      "in- machine- learning- 7904b01445d0 . For example, given three different fields \n",
      "of age, smoker (represented as 1 or 0), and body weight, the data might get condensed into a \n",
      "single PCA column that uses the following equation:\n",
      "1.5age + 30smoker + 0.2 * body- weight\n",
      "Somebody who is 20 years old, smokes, and weighs 140 pounds generates a value of 88. \n",
      "This is the same value generated by someone who is 30 years old, doesn’t smoke, and weighs \n",
      "215 pounds.\n",
      "This method can be quite robust because even if one identifies individuals who are unique \n",
      "in some way, it is hard to determine without an explanation of the PCA vector formula what \n",
      "makes them unique.\n",
      "Coarsening is another technique used to decrease the granularity of data in order to make \n",
      "it more difficult to identify sensitive data within the dataset while still giving comparable \n",

      "Feature Hashing\n",
      "Hashing works by applying a hash function to the categorical features and using their  \n",
      "hash values as indices directly rather than looking into vocabulary. Hashing often causes  \n",
      "collisions, and that is why for important terms, hashing can be worse than selecting a vocab-\n",
      "ulary. The advantage of hashing is that it doesn’t require you to assemble a vocabulary in \n",
      "case the feature distribution changes heavily over time.\n",
      "Hybrid of Hashing and Vocabulary\n",
      "In this approach you can use a vocabulary for the most important categories in your \n",
      "data and replace the out- of- bucket vocabulary categories with categories by hashing. The \n",
      "advantage of this approach is that each out- of- box category is represented with hashing and \n",
      "the model still learns the categories outside your vocabulary.\n",
      "Embedding\n",
      "Embedding is a categorical feature represented as a continuous- valued feature. Deep learning \n",
      "models frequently convert the indices from an index to an embedding. Mostly, embeddings \n",
      "are used for text classification or document classification where you have a bag of words or \n",
      "a document of words.\n",
      "Feature Selection\n",
      "Feature selection means selecting a subset of features or reducing the number of input vari-\n",
      "ables that are most useful to a model in order to predict the target variable.\n",
      "Dimensionality reduction is one of the most popular techniques for reducing the number \n",
      "of features. The advantage of this is that it reduces the noise from data and overfitting prob-\n",
      "lems. A lower number of dimensions in data means less training time and computational \n",
      "resources and increases the overall performance of machine learning algorithms. There are \n",
      "two ways this can be accomplished:\n",
      " ■Keep the most important features only: some of the techniques used are backward selec-\n",
      "tion and Random Forest.\n",
      " ■Find a combination of new features: some of the techniques used are principal compo-\n",
      "nent analysis (PCA) and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE).\n",
      "Class Imbalance\n",
      "We covered data class imbalance in Chapter 2 and in this section, we will talk about class \n",
      "imbalance specific to classification models.\n",
      "Classification models rely on some key outcomes we covered in Chapter 1, \n",
      "“Framing ML”:\n",

      " ■True negative is an outcome when the model correctly predicts the negative class, which \n",
      "means the patient who took the test has negative results and they actually are not sick.\n",
      " ■A false positive is an outcome where the model incorrectly predicts the positive class, \n",
      "meaning the patients were actually not sick but the test predicted them as sick.\n",
      " ■False negative is an outcome where the model incorrectly predicts the negative class, \n",
      "meaning the patients were sick but the test determined them as not sick.\n",
      "In this scenario, false negatives are a problem because you do not want sick patients iden-\n",
      "tified as not sick. So you would work on minimizing the false negatives outcome in your \n",
      "classification model.\n",
      "Classification Threshold with Precision and Recall\n",
      "In order to map a logistic regression value to a binary category, you define a classification \n",
      "threshold (also called the decision threshold). It is a value that a human chooses, not a \n",
      "value chosen by model training and usually for most cases this threshold is assumed to be \n",
      "0.5. A logistic regression model outputs a value between 0 and 1. Suppose the classification \n",
      "threshold is 0.6 set by the human and the value predicted by the model is 0.7, then the model \n",
      "predicts the positive class. This choice of classification threshold strongly influences the \n",
      "number of false positives and false negatives. Mostly, classification thresholds are problem- \n",
      "specific and must be fine- tuned. Precision Recall curve indicates how well a model predicts \n",
      "the positive class. Precision refers to the number of true positives divided by the total number \n",
      "of positive prediction while recall also known as the true positive rate (TPR). Recall is is the \n",
      "percentage of data samples that a machine learning model correctly identifies as belonging to \n",
      "a class of interest which is the “positive class” out of the total samples for that class.\n",
      "Both precision and recall are important to evaluate a model. However, if you improve \n",
      "precision, it will reduce recall and vice versa.\n",
      "If you want to minimize false positives, then raise the classification threshold. For these \n",
      "problems, precision is really important to you. For example, if you would rather have your \n",
      "model classify a spam email as not spam than the other way around. When you care more \n",
      "about positives than negatives, precision should be used.\n",
      "If you raise the classification threshold, it will reduce false positives, thus \n",
      "raising precision.\n",
      "If you want to minimize false negatives, then lower the classification threshold. For these \n",
      "problems, recall is really important to you. In other words, you prefer that your model clas-\n",
      "sify a non- sick patient as sick but it will be a problem if a sick patient is identified as non- \n",
      "sick. In such scenarios, if you care more about your negatives than positives, recall should \n",
      "be used.\n",
      "Recall answers the question, out of all possible positives, how many did the model cor -\n",
      "rectly identify ?\n",

      "Area under the Curve (AUC)\n",
      "In this section, we will cover two types of areas under the curve with classification problems.\n",
      "AUC ROC This is used for a balanced dataset in classification problems that have an \n",
      "equal number of examples for both the classes we are trying to predict.\n",
      "AUC PR This is used when a dataset in classification problems is imbalanced, such \n",
      "as, for example, credit card transactions to identify fraud or not fraud. Suppose you \n",
      "have 10,000 credit card transactions, the data for a fraud would be 1 in 1,000 such \n",
      "transactions.\n",
      "AUC ROC\n",
      "An ROC curve (receiver operating characteristic curve) is a graph showing the performance \n",
      "of a classification model at all classification thresholds. This curve plots two parameters: \n",
      "true positive rate and false positive rate. You can refer to this link to see what the graph \n",
      "looks like:\n",
      "https://developers.google.com/machine- learning/crash- course/\n",
      "classification/roc- and- auc\n",
      "AUC ROC (area under the ROC curve) measures the two- dimensional area underneath \n",
      "the entire ROC curve. It refers to a number between 0.0 and 1.0 representing a binary \n",
      "classification model’s ability to separate positive classes from negative classes.\n",
      "The closer the AUC is to 1.0, the better the model’s ability to separate classes from each \n",
      "other. AUC ROC curves are used when the class is balanced or when you want to give equal \n",
      "weight to both classes (negative and positive class) prediction ability.\n",
      "AUC PR\n",
      "A PR curve is a graph with Precision values on the y- axis and Recall values on the x- axis. \n",
      "The focus of the PR curve on the minority class makes it an effective diagnostic for imbal-\n",
      "anced binary classification models.\n",
      "The area under the precision- recall (AUC PR) curve measures the two-dimensional area \n",
      "underneath the precision- recall (PR) curve. In case of an imbalanced class, precision-recall \n",
      "curves (PR curves) are recommended for highly skewed domains. AUC PR gives more \n",
      "attention to the minority class. It can be used in conjunction with downsampling or upsam-\n",
      "pling, which we covered in Chapter 2.\n",
      "Feature Crosses\n",

      "For example, say your company has a learning management system (LMS), a platform \n",
      "where students subscribe to courses. You have data of students’ activities and using this you \n",
      "want to improve the experience using machine learning. You could do several things:\n",
      " ■Create a recommendation engine to show new courses for students.\n",
      " ■Churn prediction to see if a student is going to quit the course.\n",
      " ■Churn prediction to see if a teacher is not going to come back.\n",
      " ■Identify what makes a course interesting for students (sample questions, more images, \n",
      "more tables, short videos, etc.).\n",
      " ■Identify what kind of learning a student prefers (auditory, visual, or kinesthetic).\n",
      "Which of these would be most impactful is a question that can be answered only by the \n",
      "business owner.\n",
      "Once you have identified the use case with the highest impact on your business, you need \n",
      "to identify the outcome of your machine learning solution. In short, what would happen if \n",
      "you implemented your solution? Sometimes, your model would make accurate predictions, \n",
      "but the environment might react in a counterproductive way to these predictions. This is \n",
      "because the environment is seldom static; the users could adapt or the users could get con-\n",
      "fused with the behavior of the predictions.\n",
      "For example, say your company has a video sharing website, and you have millions of \n",
      "videos. You are trying to build an ML model to recommend videos to your users. You could \n",
      "choose from among the following:\n",
      " ■An ML model to recommend unseen videos from popular video creators. The problem is \n",
      "that this is not personalized. What if the user does not like some of the creators?\n",
      " ■An ML model to recommend videos that get a lot of clicks. But what if these are just \n",
      "clickbait, where people click and regret wasting time?\n",
      " ■An ML model to recommend videos that have been watched fully by similar users. This \n",
      "would lead to improving the user experience.\n",
      "In this example, you need to have a good understanding of the use case, the overall goal, \n",
      "and the end user to be able to find the right fit.\n",
      "Next, find out if the problem is even solvable using machine learning. Business leaders \n",
      "hear inspiring stories in the media about how a business solves a problem with ML and it \n",
      "sounds magical and the business leaders would love to use it to solve their business prob-\n",
      "lems. They need an expert like you to figure out if it is even feasible to solve their problem \n",
      "using ML. This is not as easy as it sounds; it depends on several things, like existing tech-\n",
      "nology, available data, and budget. For example, natural language processing has advanced \n",
      "leaps and bounds and has made it possible to do things that were impossible just a few years \n",
      "ago, such as using ML to answer a question from a piece of text. Familiarity with the lat-\n",
      "est advancements in natural language processing would help you identify easier, faster, and \n",
      "better ML methods to solve your business problems.\n",
      "As the next step, you will need to identify an ML learning approach that fits your \n",
      "use case.\n",

      "Feature Hashing\n",
      "Hashing works by applying a hash function to the categorical features and using their  \n",
      "hash values as indices directly rather than looking into vocabulary. Hashing often causes  \n",
      "collisions, and that is why for important terms, hashing can be worse than selecting a vocab-\n",
      "ulary. The advantage of hashing is that it doesn’t require you to assemble a vocabulary in \n",
      "case the feature distribution changes heavily over time.\n",
      "Hybrid of Hashing and Vocabulary\n",
      "In this approach you can use a vocabulary for the most important categories in your \n",
      "data and replace the out- of- bucket vocabulary categories with categories by hashing. The \n",
      "advantage of this approach is that each out- of- box category is represented with hashing and \n",
      "the model still learns the categories outside your vocabulary.\n",
      "Embedding\n",
      "Embedding is a categorical feature represented as a continuous- valued feature. Deep learning \n",
      "models frequently convert the indices from an index to an embedding. Mostly, embeddings \n",
      "are used for text classification or document classification where you have a bag of words or \n",
      "a document of words.\n",
      "Feature Selection\n",
      "Feature selection means selecting a subset of features or reducing the number of input vari-\n",
      "ables that are most useful to a model in order to predict the target variable.\n",
      "Dimensionality reduction is one of the most popular techniques for reducing the number \n",
      "of features. The advantage of this is that it reduces the noise from data and overfitting prob-\n",
      "lems. A lower number of dimensions in data means less training time and computational \n",
      "resources and increases the overall performance of machine learning algorithms. There are \n",
      "two ways this can be accomplished:\n",
      " ■Keep the most important features only: some of the techniques used are backward selec-\n",
      "tion and Random Forest.\n",
      " ■Find a combination of new features: some of the techniques used are principal compo-\n",
      "nent analysis (PCA) and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE).\n",

      "We covered data class imbalance in Chapter 2 and in this section, we will talk about class \n",

      " ■True negative is an outcome when the model correctly predicts the negative class, which \n",
      "means the patient who took the test has negative results and they actually are not sick.\n",
      " ■A false positive is an outcome where the model incorrectly predicts the positive class, \n",
      "meaning the patients were actually not sick but the test predicted them as sick.\n",
      " ■False negative is an outcome where the model incorrectly predicts the negative class, \n",
      "meaning the patients were sick but the test determined them as not sick.\n",
      "In this scenario, false negatives are a problem because you do not want sick patients iden-\n",
      "tified as not sick. So you would work on minimizing the false negatives outcome in your \n",
      "classification model.\n",
      "Classification Threshold with Precision and Recall\n",
      "In order to map a logistic regression value to a binary category, you define a classification \n",
      "threshold (also called the decision threshold). It is a value that a human chooses, not a \n",
      "value chosen by model training and usually for most cases this threshold is assumed to be \n",
      "0.5. A logistic regression model outputs a value between 0 and 1. Suppose the classification \n",
      "threshold is 0.6 set by the human and the value predicted by the model is 0.7, then the model \n",
      "predicts the positive class. This choice of classification threshold strongly influences the \n",
      "number of false positives and false negatives. Mostly, classification thresholds are problem- \n",
      "specific and must be fine- tuned. Precision Recall curve indicates how well a model predicts \n",
      "the positive class. Precision refers to the number of true positives divided by the total number \n",
      "of positive prediction while recall also known as the true positive rate (TPR). Recall is is the \n",
      "percentage of data samples that a machine learning model correctly identifies as belonging to \n",
      "a class of interest which is the “positive class” out of the total samples for that class.\n",
      "Both precision and recall are important to evaluate a model. However, if you improve \n",
      "precision, it will reduce recall and vice versa.\n",
      "If you want to minimize false positives, then raise the classification threshold. For these \n",
      "problems, precision is really important to you. For example, if you would rather have your \n",
      "model classify a spam email as not spam than the other way around. When you care more \n",
      "about positives than negatives, precision should be used.\n",
      "If you raise the classification threshold, it will reduce false positives, thus \n",
      "raising precision.\n",
      "If you want to minimize false negatives, then lower the classification threshold. For these \n",
      "problems, recall is really important to you. In other words, you prefer that your model clas-\n",
      "sify a non- sick patient as sick but it will be a problem if a sick patient is identified as non- \n",
      "sick. In such scenarios, if you care more about your negatives than positives, recall should \n",
      "be used.\n",
      "Recall answers the question, out of all possible positives, how many did the model cor -\n",

      "The closer the AUC is to 1.0, the better the model’s ability to separate classes from each \n",

      "Organizing and Optimizing \n",
      "Training Datasets\n",
      "You learned in the previous section how to check for data quality. In this section, we will \n",
      "talk about data sampling, imbalanced data, and how to split your dataset. We generally \n",
      "divide the data into training, test, and validation dataset (see Figure 2.6).\n",
      "Training Dataset This is the actual dataset that we use to train the model, and our \n",
      "model learns from this data.\n",
      "Validation Dataset This is a subset of data that is used for the evaluation of the model. \n",
      "This data is used for hyperparameter tuning. The model does not use this data to learn \n",
      "from it, unlike training data. It is used for improving the model behavior after training.\n",
      "Test Dataset This is the sample of data used to test or evaluate the performance of \n",
      "your model. The test set is different from the training and validation sets as it’s used \n",
      "after model training and model validation. The test set should not contain the data \n",
      "samples in the validation or training set because it might cause data leakage. Also, you \n",
      "should never train your data using the test set.\n",
      "Imbalanced Data\n",
      "When two classes in a dataset are not equal, the result is imbalanced data. In the example \n",
      "shown in Figure 2.7, there is less chance of credit card fraud in the dataset compared to \n",
      "No fraud.\n",
      "In the case of credit card transactions, suppose, out of all transactions, 1,000 are not \n",
      "fraud examples and only five are fraud transactions. This is a classic representation of imbal-\n",
      "anced data. In this scenario, we do not have enough transactions to train the model to clas-\n",
      "sify whether a credit card transaction is fraud. The training model will spend more time on  \n",
      "no- fraud scenarios.\n",
      "In a random sampling, you can perform either oversampling, which means duplicating \n",
      "samples from the minority class, or undersampling, which means deleting samples from the \n",
      "majority class. Both of these approaches include bias because they introduce either more \n",
      "samples or fewer samples to remove imbalance.\n",

      "Now let’s upweight the downsampled class. Since we downsampled by a factor of 10, \n",
      "the example weight should be 10. Example weight means counting an individual example \n",
      "as more important during training. An example weight of 10 means the model treats the \n",
      "example as 10 times as important (when computing loss) as it would for an example of \n",
      "weight 1. Refer to https://developers.google.com/machine- learning/data- \n",
      "prep/construct/sampling- splitting/imbalanced- data  to learn more.\n",
      "One of the advantages of downsampling and upweighting the downsampled class is faster \n",
      "model convergence because we have more of the minority class examples compared to the \n",
      "data before downsampling and upweighting.\n",
      "Data Splitting\n",
      "Mostly with general data cleaning, you would start with random splitting of the data. For \n",
      "example, consider datasets having naturally clustered examples.\n",
      "Say you want your model to classify the topics in the text of a book. The topics can be \n",
      "horror, love story, and drama. A random split would be a problem in that case.\n",
      "Why would having a random split cause a skew? It can cause a skew because stories with \n",
      "the same type of topic are written on the same timeline. If the data is split randomly, the test \n",
      "set and training set might contain the same stories.\n",
      "To fix this, try splitting the data based on the time the  story was published. For example, \n",
      "you can put stories written in June in the training set and stories published in July in the \n",
      "test set.\n",
      "Another simple approach to fixing this problem would be to split the data based on when \n",
      "the story was published. For example, you could train on stories for the month of April and \n",
      "then use the second week of May as the test set to prevent overlap.\n",
      "Data Splitting Strategy for Online Systems\n",
      "For online systems, it’s recommended to split the data by time as the training data is older \n",
      "than the serving data. By splitting data by time, you ensure your validation set mirrors the \n",
      "lag of time between training and prediction.\n",
      "Here are the steps:\n",
      "1. Perform data collection for 30 days.\n",
      "2. Create a training set for data from day 1 to day 29.\n",
      "3. Create a validation set for data for day 30.\n",
      "Generally, time- based splits work best with very large datasets, such as, for example, data \n",
      "with millions of examples.\n",
      "When it is clustered data— for example, a book or an online system— you have to make \n",
      "sure that you split the data in a way that your model will not get trained using information \n",
      "not available at prediction time. That’s why you should use a time- based approach rather \n",
      "than a random split. For data splitting, you should always use domain knowledge to under -\n",
      "stand when a random split will work versus when to do a time- based split.\n",

      "Mode is used if there is an outlier and the majority of the data is the same. Mode is the value \n",
      "or values in the dataset that occur most.\n",
      "For example, for the dataset 1, 1, 2, 5, 5, 5, 9, the mode is 5.\n",
      "Outlier Detection\n",
      "Mean is the measure of central tendency that is affected by the outliers, which in turn \n",
      "impacts standard deviation.\n",
      "For example, consider the following small dataset:\n",
      "[15, 18, 7, 13, 16, 11, 21, 5, 15, 10, 9, 210]\n",
      "By looking at it, one can quickly say 210 is an outlier that is much larger than the \n",
      "other values.\n",
      "As you can see from Table 2.1, there has been a significant change in mean by adding an \n",
      "outlier compared to median and mode. Variance is the average of the squared differences \n",
      "from the mean.\n",
      "Standard Deviation\n",
      "Standard deviation is the square root of the variance. Standard deviation is an excellent way \n",
      "to identify outliers. Data points that lie more than one standard deviation from the mean can \n",
      "be considered unusual.\n",
      "Covariance is a measure of how much two random variables vary from \n",

      "learning as your model is only as good as your data. Most of \n",
      "the time in machine learning is spent cleaning data and feature \n",
      "engineering. In this chapter, we will focus on data cleaning and exploratory data analysis \n",
      "(EDA). We will talk about data visualization and statistical techniques to check for bad data \n",
      "(omitted values, outliers, duplicate values). Then we will cover how to normalize the data \n",
      "and handle bad data (such as having a data schema), how to handle missing data, and how \n",
      "to check for data leakage. We will also cover how you can use TensorFlow Data Validation \n",
      "(TFDV) to validate data for large- scale systems.\n",
      "Visualization\n",
      "Data visualization is a data exploratory technique to find trends and outliers in the data. \n",
      "Data visualization helps in the data cleaning process because you can find out whether your \n",
      "data is imbalanced by visualizing the data on a chart. It also helps in the feature engineering \n",
      "process because you can select features and discard features and see how a feature will \n",
      "influence your model by visualizing it.\n",
      "There are two ways to visualize data:\n",
      "Univariate Analysis In this analysis, each of the features is analyzed independently, \n",
      "such as the range of the feature and whether outliers exist in the data. The most \n",
      "common visuals used for this are box plots and distribution plots.\n",
      "Bivariate Analysis In this analysis, we compare the data between two features. This \n",
      "analysis can be helpful in finding correlation between features. Some of the ways you \n",
      "can perform this analysis are by using line plots, bar plots, and scatterplots.\n",
      "Box Plot\n",
      "A box plot helps visualize the division of observations into defined intervals known as quar -\n",
      "tiles and how that compares to the entire observation. It represents the data as 25th, 50th, \n",
      "and 75th quartiles. It consists of the body, or interquartile range, where maximum observa-\n",
      "tions are present. Whiskers or straight lines represent the maximum and minimum. Points \n",
      "that lie outside the whiskers will be considered outliers.\n",

      "Scatterplot\n",
      "A scatterplot is the most common plot used in data science and is mostly used to visualize \n",
      "clusters in a dataset and show the relationship between two variables.\n",
      "Statistics Fundamentals\n",
      "In statistics, we have three measures of central tendency: mean, median, and mode. They \n",
      "help us describe the data and can be used to clean data statistically.\n",
      "Mean\n",
      "Mean is the accurate measure to describe the data when we do not have any outliers present.\n",
      "Median\n",
      "Median is used if there is an outlier in the dataset. You can find the median by arranging \n",
      "data values from the lowest to the highest value.\n",
      "If there are even numbers, the median is the average of two numbers in the middle, and if \n",
      "there are odd numbers, the median is the middle value. For example, in the dataset 1, 1, 2, 4, \n",
      "6, 6, 9, the median is 4. For the dataset 1, 1, 4, 6, 6, 9, the median is 5. Take the mean of 4 \n",
      "and 6, or (4+6) / 2 = 5.\n",

      "Mode\n",
      "Mode is used if there is an outlier and the majority of the data is the same. Mode is the value \n",
      "or values in the dataset that occur most.\n",
      "For example, for the dataset 1, 1, 2, 5, 5, 5, 9, the mode is 5.\n",
      "Outlier Detection\n",
      "Mean is the measure of central tendency that is affected by the outliers, which in turn \n",
      "impacts standard deviation.\n",
      "For example, consider the following small dataset:\n",
      "[15, 18, 7, 13, 16, 11, 21, 5, 15, 10, 9, 210]\n",
      "By looking at it, one can quickly say 210 is an outlier that is much larger than the \n",
      "other values.\n",
      "As you can see from Table 2.1, there has been a significant change in mean by adding an \n",
      "outlier compared to median and mode. Variance is the average of the squared differences \n",
      "from the mean.\n",
      "Standard Deviation\n",
      "Standard deviation is the square root of the variance. Standard deviation is an excellent way \n",
      "to identify outliers. Data points that lie more than one standard deviation from the mean can \n",
      "be considered unusual.\n",
      "Covariance is a measure of how much two random variables vary from \n",
      "each other.\n",

      "Data visualization helps in the data cleaning process because you can find out whether your \n",

      "process because you can select features and discard features and see how a feature will \n",
      "influence your model by visualizing it.\n",
      "There are two ways to visualize data:\n",
      "Univariate Analysis In this analysis, each of the features is analyzed independently, \n",
      "such as the range of the feature and whether outliers exist in the data. The most \n",

      "If there are even numbers, the median is the average of two numbers in the middle, and if \n",
      "there are odd numbers, the median is the middle value. For example, in the dataset 1, 1, 2, 4, \n",

      "Outlier Detection\n",
      "Mean is the measure of central tendency that is affected by the outliers, which in turn \n",
      "impacts standard deviation.\n",
      "For example, consider the following small dataset:\n",

      "By looking at it, one can quickly say 210 is an outlier that is much larger than the \n",
      "other values.\n",
      "As you can see from Table 2.1, there has been a significant change in mean by adding an \n",
      "outlier compared to median and mode. Variance is the average of the squared differences \n",

      "Standard Deviation\n",
      "Standard deviation is the square root of the variance. Standard deviation is an excellent way \n",

      "Feature Hashing\n",
      "Hashing works by applying a hash function to the categorical features and using their  \n",
      "hash values as indices directly rather than looking into vocabulary. Hashing often causes  \n",
      "collisions, and that is why for important terms, hashing can be worse than selecting a vocab-\n",
      "ulary. The advantage of hashing is that it doesn’t require you to assemble a vocabulary in \n",
      "case the feature distribution changes heavily over time.\n",
      "Hybrid of Hashing and Vocabulary\n",
      "In this approach you can use a vocabulary for the most important categories in your \n",
      "data and replace the out- of- bucket vocabulary categories with categories by hashing. The \n",
      "advantage of this approach is that each out- of- box category is represented with hashing and \n",
      "the model still learns the categories outside your vocabulary.\n",
      "Embedding\n",
      "Embedding is a categorical feature represented as a continuous- valued feature. Deep learning \n",
      "models frequently convert the indices from an index to an embedding. Mostly, embeddings \n",
      "are used for text classification or document classification where you have a bag of words or \n",
      "a document of words.\n",
      "Feature Selection\n",
      "Feature selection means selecting a subset of features or reducing the number of input vari-\n",
      "ables that are most useful to a model in order to predict the target variable.\n",
      "Dimensionality reduction is one of the most popular techniques for reducing the number \n",
      "of features. The advantage of this is that it reduces the noise from data and overfitting prob-\n",
      "lems. A lower number of dimensions in data means less training time and computational \n",
      "resources and increases the overall performance of machine learning algorithms. There are \n",
      "two ways this can be accomplished:\n",
      " ■Keep the most important features only: some of the techniques used are backward selec-\n",
      "tion and Random Forest.\n",
      " ■Find a combination of new features: some of the techniques used are principal compo-\n",
      "nent analysis (PCA) and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE).\n",
      "Class Imbalance\n",
      "We covered data class imbalance in Chapter 2 and in this section, we will talk about class \n",
      "imbalance specific to classification models.\n",
      "Classification models rely on some key outcomes we covered in Chapter 1, \n",

      " ■True negative is an outcome when the model correctly predicts the negative class, which \n",
      "means the patient who took the test has negative results and they actually are not sick.\n",
      " ■A false positive is an outcome where the model incorrectly predicts the positive class, \n",
      "meaning the patients were actually not sick but the test predicted them as sick.\n",
      " ■False negative is an outcome where the model incorrectly predicts the negative class, \n",
      "meaning the patients were sick but the test determined them as not sick.\n",
      "In this scenario, false negatives are a problem because you do not want sick patients iden-\n",
      "tified as not sick. So you would work on minimizing the false negatives outcome in your \n",
      "classification model.\n",
      "Classification Threshold with Precision and Recall\n",
      "In order to map a logistic regression value to a binary category, you define a classification \n",
      "threshold (also called the decision threshold). It is a value that a human chooses, not a \n",
      "value chosen by model training and usually for most cases this threshold is assumed to be \n",
      "0.5. A logistic regression model outputs a value between 0 and 1. Suppose the classification \n",
      "threshold is 0.6 set by the human and the value predicted by the model is 0.7, then the model \n",
      "predicts the positive class. This choice of classification threshold strongly influences the \n",
      "number of false positives and false negatives. Mostly, classification thresholds are problem- \n",
      "specific and must be fine- tuned. Precision Recall curve indicates how well a model predicts \n",
      "the positive class. Precision refers to the number of true positives divided by the total number \n",
      "of positive prediction while recall also known as the true positive rate (TPR). Recall is is the \n",
      "percentage of data samples that a machine learning model correctly identifies as belonging to \n",
      "a class of interest which is the “positive class” out of the total samples for that class.\n",
      "Both precision and recall are important to evaluate a model. However, if you improve \n",
      "precision, it will reduce recall and vice versa.\n",
      "If you want to minimize false positives, then raise the classification threshold. For these \n",
      "problems, precision is really important to you. For example, if you would rather have your \n",
      "model classify a spam email as not spam than the other way around. When you care more \n",
      "about positives than negatives, precision should be used.\n",
      "If you raise the classification threshold, it will reduce false positives, thus \n",
      "raising precision.\n",
      "If you want to minimize false negatives, then lower the classification threshold. For these \n",
      "problems, recall is really important to you. In other words, you prefer that your model clas-\n",
      "sify a non- sick patient as sick but it will be a problem if a sick patient is identified as non- \n",
      "sick. In such scenarios, if you care more about your negatives than positives, recall should \n",
      "be used.\n",

      "Area under the Curve (AUC)\n",
      "In this section, we will cover two types of areas under the curve with classification problems.\n",
      "AUC ROC This is used for a balanced dataset in classification problems that have an \n",
      "equal number of examples for both the classes we are trying to predict.\n",
      "AUC PR This is used when a dataset in classification problems is imbalanced, such \n",
      "as, for example, credit card transactions to identify fraud or not fraud. Suppose you \n",
      "have 10,000 credit card transactions, the data for a fraud would be 1 in 1,000 such \n",
      "transactions.\n",
      "AUC ROC\n",
      "An ROC curve (receiver operating characteristic curve) is a graph showing the performance \n",
      "of a classification model at all classification thresholds. This curve plots two parameters: \n",
      "true positive rate and false positive rate. You can refer to this link to see what the graph \n",
      "looks like:\n",
      "https://developers.google.com/machine- learning/crash- course/\n",
      "classification/roc- and- auc\n",
      "AUC ROC (area under the ROC curve) measures the two- dimensional area underneath \n",
      "the entire ROC curve. It refers to a number between 0.0 and 1.0 representing a binary \n",
      "classification model’s ability to separate positive classes from negative classes.\n",
      "The closer the AUC is to 1.0, the better the model’s ability to separate classes from each \n",
      "other. AUC ROC curves are used when the class is balanced or when you want to give equal \n",
      "weight to both classes (negative and positive class) prediction ability.\n",
      "AUC PR\n",
      "A PR curve is a graph with Precision values on the y- axis and Recall values on the x- axis. \n",
      "The focus of the PR curve on the minority class makes it an effective diagnostic for imbal-\n",
      "anced binary classification models.\n",
      "The area under the precision- recall (AUC PR) curve measures the two-dimensional area \n",
      "underneath the precision- recall (PR) curve. In case of an imbalanced class, precision-recall \n",
      "curves (PR curves) are recommended for highly skewed domains. AUC PR gives more \n",

      "train your model effectively, you would need to think of ways to handle missing data.\n",
      "The following list includes some of the ways to handle missing data:\n",
      " ■Delete the rows or columns with missing values such as null or NaN. If a column has \n",
      "more than half of the rows as null, then the entire column can be dropped. The rows \n",
      "that have one or more column values as null can also be dropped. The disadvantage of \n",
      "this approach is that information is lost and the model will perform poorly if a large \n",
      "percentage of data is missing in a complete dataset.\n",
      " ■Replace missing values for numeric continuous columns or features such as age or \n",
      "interest rate in your dataset having missing values. You can replace missing values with \n",
      "the mean, median, or mode of remaining values in the column. This method can prevent \n",
      "the loss of data compared to removing or deleting the columns or rows. This method \n",
      "works well with small datasets. Also, this method does not factor in the covariance bet-\n",
      "ween features and can cause data leakage, which we will discuss in the next section.\n",
      " ■For missing values in categorical columns (string or numerical), the missing values \n",
      "can be replaced with the most frequent category. This method is called the imputa-\n",
      "tion method. If the number of missing values is very large, then missing values can be \n",
      "replaced with a new category. The disadvantage of this method is encoding the extra \n",
      "added features while one-hot encoding.\n",
      " ■You can use the last valid observation to fill in the missing value. This is known as the \n",
      "last observation carried forward (LOCF) method. This method can reduce bias.\n",
      " ■For the time- series dataset, you can use the interpolation of the variable before and after \n",
      "a time stamp for a missing value.\n",
      " ■ML algorithms that can ignore missing values in data can also be used. For example, \n",
      "the k- nearest neighbors (k- NN) algorithm can ignore a column from a distance measure \n",
      "when a value is missing. Naive Bayes can also support missing values when making a \n",
      "prediction.\n",
      "Also, the Random Forest algorithm works well on nonlinear and categorical data. It \n",
      "adapts to the data structure, taking into consideration the high variance or the bias, \n",
      "producing better results on large datasets.\n",
      " ■Use machine learning to predict missing values. The correlation between the variable \n",
      "containing the missing value and other variables can be used to predict missing values. \n",
      "The regression or classification model can be used for the prediction of missing values \n",

      "Copyright © 2023. John Wiley & Sons, Incorporated. All rights reserved. Data Leakage  33\n",
      "Data Leakage\n",
      "Data leakage happens when you expose your machine learning model to the test data during \n",
      "training. As a result, your model performs great during training and testing, but when you \n",
      "expose the model to unseen data, it underperforms. Data leakage leads to overfitting in the \n",
      "model as the model has already learned from the test and training data.\n",
      "The following are some of the reasons for data leakage:\n",
      " ■The target variable is the output that your model is trying to predict, and features are \n",
      "the data that is fed into the model to make a prediction or predict the target variable. \n",
      "The cause of data leakage is that by mistake you have added your target variable as \n",
      "your feature.\n",
      " ■While splitting the test data and the training data for model training, you have included \n",
      "the test data with the training data.\n",
      " ■The presence of features that expose the information about the target variable will not \n",
      "be available after the model is deployed. This is also called label leakage and can be \n",
      "detected by checking the correlation between the target variable and the feature.\n",
      " ■Applying preprocessing techniques (normalizing features, removing outliers, etc.) to the \n",
      "entire dataset will cause the model to learn not only the training set but also the test set, \n",
      "which leads to data leakage.\n",
      "A classic example of data leakage is time- series data. For example, when dealing with \n",
      "time- series data, if we use data from the future when doing computations for current fea-\n",
      "tures or predictions, we would highly likely end up with a leaked model. It generally hap-\n",
      "pens when the data is randomly split into train and test subsets.\n",
      "These are the situations where you might have data leakage:\n",
      " ■If the model’s predicted output is as good as actual output, it might be because of a data \n",
      "leakage. This means the model might be somehow memorizing the data or might have \n",
      "been exposed to the actual data.\n",
      " ■While doing the exploratory data analysis, having features that are very highly corre-\n",
      "lated with the target variable might be a data leakage.\n",
      "Data leakage happens primarily because of the way  we split our data and when we split \n",
      "our data. Now, let’s understand how to prevent data leakage:\n",
      " ■Select features that are not correlated with a given target variable or that don’t contain \n",
      "information about the target variable.\n",
      " ■Split the data into test, train, and validation sets. The purpose of the validation set is to \n",
      "mimic the real- life scenario and it will help identify any possible case of overfitting.\n",
      " ■Preprocess the training and test data separately. You would perform normalization on \n",
      "training data rather than on the complete dataset to avoid any leakage.\n",

      " ■In case of time- series data, have a cutoff value on time as it prevents you from getting \n",
      "any information after the time of prediction.\n",
      " ■Cross- validation is another approach to avoid data leakage when you have limited data. \n",
      "However, if data leakage still happens, then scale or normalize the data and compute the \n",
      "parameters on each fold of cross- validation separately.\n",

      "of age, smoker (represented as 1 or 0), and body weight, the data might get condensed into a \n",
      "single PCA column that uses the following equation:\n",
      "1.5age + 30smoker + 0.2 * body- weight\n",
      "Somebody who is 20 years old, smokes, and weighs 140 pounds generates a value of 88. \n",
      "This is the same value generated by someone who is 30 years old, doesn’t smoke, and weighs \n",
      "215 pounds.\n",

      "in some way, it is hard to determine without an explanation of the PCA vector formula what \n",

      "Federated Learning\n",
      "According to the Google AI blog, https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/04/federated- \n",
      " learning- collaborative.html , federated learning is a technique that is used to enable \n",
      "mobile phones to collaboratively learn a shared prediction model while keeping all the \n",
      "training data on the device. The device downloads the model and learns from the device \n",
      "data. This updated model is then sent to the cloud with encrypted communication. Since \n",
      "all the training data remains on your device, federated learning allows for smarter models, \n",
      "lower latency, and less power consumption, all while ensuring privacy.\n",
      "An example would be a group of hospitals around the world that are participating in \n",
      "the same clinical trial. The data that an individual hospital collects about patients is not \n",
      "shared outside the hospital. As a result, hospitals can’t transfer or share patient data with \n",
      "third parties. Federated learning lets affiliated hospitals train shared ML models while still \n",
      "retaining security, privacy, and control of patient data within each hospital by using a cen-\n",
      "tralized model shared by all the hospitals. This model trains local data in the hospital, and \n",
      "only the model update is sent back to the centralized cloud server. The model updates are \n",
      "decrypted, averaged, and integrated into the centralized model. Iteration after iteration, the \n",
      "collaborative training continues until the model is fully trained. This way federated learning \n",
      "decouples the ability to do machine learning from the need to store the data in the cloud. \n",
      "Refer to this link for more information: https://cloud.google.com/architecture/\n",
      "federated- learning- google- cloud .\n",
      "Differential Privacy\n",
      "According to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy , differential \n",
      "privacy (DP) is a system for publicly sharing information about a dataset by describing the \n",
      "patterns within groups of individuals within the dataset while withholding information \n",
      "about each individual in the dataset. For example, training a machine learning model for \n",
      "medical diagnosis, we would like to have machine learning algorithms that do not mem-\n",
      "orize sensitive information about the training set, such as the specific medical histories of \n",
      "individual patients. Differential privacy is a notion that allows quantifying the degree of pri-\n",
      "vacy protection provided by an algorithm for the underlying (sensitive) dataset it operates \n",
      "on. Through differential privacy, we can design machine learning algorithms that responsibly \n",
      "train models on private data.\n",

      "There are two ways to visualize data:\n",
      "Univariate Analysis In this analysis, each of the features is analyzed independently, \n",

      "Box Plot\n",
      "A box plot helps visualize the division of observations into defined intervals known as quar -\n",

      "If there are even numbers, the median is the average of two numbers in the middle, and if \n",
      "there are odd numbers, the median is the middle value. For example, in the dataset 1, 1, 2, 4, \n",

      "Outlier Detection\n",
      "Mean is the measure of central tendency that is affected by the outliers, which in turn \n",

      "By looking at it, one can quickly say 210 is an outlier that is much larger than the \n",
      "other values.\n",
      "As you can see from Table 2.1, there has been a significant change in mean by adding an \n",
      "outlier compared to median and mode. Variance is the average of the squared differences \n",
      "from the mean.\n",
      "Standard Deviation\n",
      "Standard deviation is the square root of the variance. Standard deviation is an excellent way \n",

      "Training Datasets\n",
      "You learned in the previous section how to check for data quality. In this section, we will \n",
      "talk about data sampling, imbalanced data, and how to split your dataset. We generally \n",
      "divide the data into training, test, and validation dataset (see Figure 2.6).\n",
      "Training Dataset This is the actual dataset that we use to train the model, and our \n",
      "model learns from this data.\n",
      "Validation Dataset This is a subset of data that is used for the evaluation of the model. \n",
      "This data is used for hyperparameter tuning. The model does not use this data to learn \n",
      "from it, unlike training data. It is used for improving the model behavior after training.\n",
      "Test Dataset This is the sample of data used to test or evaluate the performance of \n",
      "your model. The test set is different from the training and validation sets as it’s used \n",
      "after model training and model validation. The test set should not contain the data \n",
      "samples in the validation or training set because it might cause data leakage. Also, you \n",
      "should never train your data using the test set.\n",
      "Imbalanced Data\n",
      "When two classes in a dataset are not equal, the result is imbalanced data. In the example \n",
      "shown in Figure 2.7, there is less chance of credit card fraud in the dataset compared to \n",
      "No fraud.\n",
      "In the case of credit card transactions, suppose, out of all transactions, 1,000 are not \n",
      "fraud examples and only five are fraud transactions. This is a classic representation of imbal-\n",
      "anced data. In this scenario, we do not have enough transactions to train the model to clas-\n",
      "sify whether a credit card transaction is fraud. The training model will spend more time on  \n",
      "no- fraud scenarios.\n",
      "In a random sampling, you can perform either oversampling, which means duplicating \n",
      "samples from the minority class, or undersampling, which means deleting samples from the \n",
      "majority class. Both of these approaches include bias because they introduce either more \n",
      "samples or fewer samples to remove imbalance.\n",

      "Now let’s upweight the downsampled class. Since we downsampled by a factor of 10, \n",
      "the example weight should be 10. Example weight means counting an individual example \n",
      "as more important during training. An example weight of 10 means the model treats the \n",
      "example as 10 times as important (when computing loss) as it would for an example of \n",
      "weight 1. Refer to https://developers.google.com/machine- learning/data- \n",
      "prep/construct/sampling- splitting/imbalanced- data  to learn more.\n",
      "One of the advantages of downsampling and upweighting the downsampled class is faster \n",
      "model convergence because we have more of the minority class examples compared to the \n",
      "data before downsampling and upweighting.\n",
      "Data Splitting\n",
      "Mostly with general data cleaning, you would start with random splitting of the data. For \n",
      "example, consider datasets having naturally clustered examples.\n",
      "Say you want your model to classify the topics in the text of a book. The topics can be \n",
      "horror, love story, and drama. A random split would be a problem in that case.\n",
      "Why would having a random split cause a skew? It can cause a skew because stories with \n",
      "the same type of topic are written on the same timeline. If the data is split randomly, the test \n",
      "set and training set might contain the same stories.\n",
      "To fix this, try splitting the data based on the time the  story was published. For example, \n",
      "you can put stories written in June in the training set and stories published in July in the \n",
      "test set.\n",
      "Another simple approach to fixing this problem would be to split the data based on when \n",
      "the story was published. For example, you could train on stories for the month of April and \n",
      "then use the second week of May as the test set to prevent overlap.\n",
      "Data Splitting Strategy for Online Systems\n",
      "For online systems, it’s recommended to split the data by time as the training data is older \n",
      "than the serving data. By splitting data by time, you ensure your validation set mirrors the \n",
      "lag of time between training and prediction.\n",
      "Here are the steps:\n",
      "1. Perform data collection for 30 days.\n",
      "2. Create a training set for data from day 1 to day 29.\n",
      "3. Create a validation set for data for day 30.\n",
      "Generally, time- based splits work best with very large datasets, such as, for example, data \n",
      "with millions of examples.\n",
      "When it is clustered data— for example, a book or an online system— you have to make \n",
      "sure that you split the data in a way that your model will not get trained using information \n",
      "not available at prediction time. That’s why you should use a time- based approach rather \n",
      "than a random split. For data splitting, you should always use domain knowledge to under -\n",
      "stand when a random split will work versus when to do a time- based split.\n",

      "of age, smoker (represented as 1 or 0), and body weight, the data might get condensed into a \n",
      "single PCA column that uses the following equation:\n",
      "1.5age + 30smoker + 0.2 * body- weight\n",
      "Somebody who is 20 years old, smokes, and weighs 140 pounds generates a value of 88. \n",
      "This is the same value generated by someone who is 30 years old, doesn’t smoke, and weighs \n",
      "215 pounds.\n",

      "Copyright © 2023. John Wiley & Sons, Incorporated. All rights reserved. Data collecting and cleaning is a major step in machine \n",
      "learning as your model is only as good as your data. Most of \n",
      "the time in machine learning is spent cleaning data and feature \n",
      "engineering. In this chapter, we will focus on data cleaning and exploratory data analysis \n",
      "(EDA). We will talk about data visualization and statistical techniques to check for bad data \n",
      "(omitted values, outliers, duplicate values). Then we will cover how to normalize the data \n",
      "and handle bad data (such as having a data schema), how to handle missing data, and how \n",
      "to check for data leakage. We will also cover how you can use TensorFlow Data Validation \n",
      "(TFDV) to validate data for large- scale systems.\n",
      "Visualization\n",
      "Data visualization is a data exploratory technique to find trends and outliers in the data. \n",
      "Data visualization helps in the data cleaning process because you can find out whether your \n",
      "data is imbalanced by visualizing the data on a chart. It also helps in the feature engineering \n",
      "process because you can select features and discard features and see how a feature will \n",
      "influence your model by visualizing it.\n",
      "There are two ways to visualize data:\n",
      "Univariate Analysis In this analysis, each of the features is analyzed independently, \n",
      "such as the range of the feature and whether outliers exist in the data. The most \n",
      "common visuals used for this are box plots and distribution plots.\n",
      "Bivariate Analysis In this analysis, we compare the data between two features. This \n",
      "analysis can be helpful in finding correlation between features. Some of the ways you \n",
      "can perform this analysis are by using line plots, bar plots, and scatterplots.\n",
      "Box Plot\n",
      "A box plot helps visualize the division of observations into defined intervals known as quar -\n",
      "tiles and how that compares to the entire observation. It represents the data as 25th, 50th, \n",
      "and 75th quartiles. It consists of the body, or interquartile range, where maximum observa-\n",
      "tions are present. Whiskers or straight lines represent the maximum and minimum. Points \n",
      "that lie outside the whiskers will be considered outliers.\n",

      "A scatterplot is the most common plot used in data science and is mostly used to visualize \n",

      "Statistics Fundamentals\n",
      "In statistics, we have three measures of central tendency: mean, median, and mode. They \n",
      "help us describe the data and can be used to clean data statistically.\n",
      "Mean\n",
      "Mean is the accurate measure to describe the data when we do not have any outliers present.\n",
      "Median\n",
      "Median is used if there is an outlier in the dataset. You can find the median by arranging \n",
      "data values from the lowest to the highest value.\n",
      "If there are even numbers, the median is the average of two numbers in the middle, and if \n",
      "there are odd numbers, the median is the middle value. For example, in the dataset 1, 1, 2, 4, \n",
      "6, 6, 9, the median is 4. For the dataset 1, 1, 4, 6, 6, 9, the median is 5. Take the mean of 4 \n",
      "and 6, or (4+6) / 2 = 5.\n",

      "Mode\n",
      "Mode is used if there is an outlier and the majority of the data is the same. Mode is the value \n",
      "or values in the dataset that occur most.\n",
      "For example, for the dataset 1, 1, 2, 5, 5, 5, 9, the mode is 5.\n",
      "Outlier Detection\n",
      "Mean is the measure of central tendency that is affected by the outliers, which in turn \n",
      "impacts standard deviation.\n",
      "For example, consider the following small dataset:\n",
      "[15, 18, 7, 13, 16, 11, 21, 5, 15, 10, 9, 210]\n",
      "By looking at it, one can quickly say 210 is an outlier that is much larger than the \n",
      "other values.\n",
      "As you can see from Table 2.1, there has been a significant change in mean by adding an \n",
      "outlier compared to median and mode. Variance is the average of the squared differences \n",
      "from the mean.\n",
      "Standard Deviation\n",
      "Standard deviation is the square root of the variance. Standard deviation is an excellent way \n",
      "to identify outliers. Data points that lie more than one standard deviation from the mean can \n",
      "be considered unusual.\n",
      "Covariance is a measure of how much two random variables vary from \n",
      "each other.\n",

      "Now let’s upweight the downsampled class. Since we downsampled by a factor of 10, \n",
      "the example weight should be 10. Example weight means counting an individual example \n",
      "as more important during training. An example weight of 10 means the model treats the \n",
      "example as 10 times as important (when computing loss) as it would for an example of \n",
      "weight 1. Refer to https://developers.google.com/machine- learning/data- \n",
      "prep/construct/sampling- splitting/imbalanced- data  to learn more.\n",
      "One of the advantages of downsampling and upweighting the downsampled class is faster \n",
      "model convergence because we have more of the minority class examples compared to the \n",
      "data before downsampling and upweighting.\n",
      "Data Splitting\n",
      "Mostly with general data cleaning, you would start with random splitting of the data. For \n",
      "example, consider datasets having naturally clustered examples.\n",
      "Say you want your model to classify the topics in the text of a book. The topics can be \n",
      "horror, love story, and drama. A random split would be a problem in that case.\n",
      "Why would having a random split cause a skew? It can cause a skew because stories with \n",
      "the same type of topic are written on the same timeline. If the data is split randomly, the test \n",
      "set and training set might contain the same stories.\n",
      "To fix this, try splitting the data based on the time the  story was published. For example, \n",
      "you can put stories written in June in the training set and stories published in July in the \n",
      "test set.\n",
      "Another simple approach to fixing this problem would be to split the data based on when \n",
      "the story was published. For example, you could train on stories for the month of April and \n",
      "then use the second week of May as the test set to prevent overlap.\n",
      "Data Splitting Strategy for Online Systems\n",
      "For online systems, it’s recommended to split the data by time as the training data is older \n",
      "than the serving data. By splitting data by time, you ensure your validation set mirrors the \n",
      "lag of time between training and prediction.\n",
      "Here are the steps:\n",
      "1. Perform data collection for 30 days.\n",
      "2. Create a training set for data from day 1 to day 29.\n",
      "3. Create a validation set for data for day 30.\n",
      "Generally, time- based splits work best with very large datasets, such as, for example, data \n",
      "with millions of examples.\n",
      "When it is clustered data— for example, a book or an online system— you have to make \n",
      "sure that you split the data in a way that your model will not get trained using information \n",
      "not available at prediction time. That’s why you should use a time- based approach rather \n",
      "than a random split. For data splitting, you should always use domain knowledge to under -\n",
      "stand when a random split will work versus when to do a time- based split.\n",

      "Copyright © 2023. John Wiley & Sons, Incorporated. All rights reserved. 4 Chapter 1 ■ Framing ML Problems\n",
      "For example, say your company has a learning management system (LMS), a platform \n",
      "where students subscribe to courses. You have data of students’ activities and using this you \n",
      "want to improve the experience using machine learning. You could do several things:\n",
      " ■Create a recommendation engine to show new courses for students.\n",
      " ■Churn prediction to see if a student is going to quit the course.\n",
      " ■Churn prediction to see if a teacher is not going to come back.\n",
      " ■Identify what makes a course interesting for students (sample questions, more images, \n",
      "more tables, short videos, etc.).\n",
      " ■Identify what kind of learning a student prefers (auditory, visual, or kinesthetic).\n",
      "Which of these would be most impactful is a question that can be answered only by the \n",
      "business owner.\n",
      "Once you have identified the use case with the highest impact on your business, you need \n",
      "to identify the outcome of your machine learning solution. In short, what would happen if \n",
      "you implemented your solution? Sometimes, your model would make accurate predictions, \n",
      "but the environment might react in a counterproductive way to these predictions. This is \n",
      "because the environment is seldom static; the users could adapt or the users could get con-\n",
      "fused with the behavior of the predictions.\n",
      "For example, say your company has a video sharing website, and you have millions of \n",
      "videos. You are trying to build an ML model to recommend videos to your users. You could \n",
      "choose from among the following:\n",
      " ■An ML model to recommend unseen videos from popular video creators. The problem is \n",
      "that this is not personalized. What if the user does not like some of the creators?\n",
      " ■An ML model to recommend videos that get a lot of clicks. But what if these are just \n",
      "clickbait, where people click and regret wasting time?\n",
      " ■An ML model to recommend videos that have been watched fully by similar users. This \n",
      "would lead to improving the user experience.\n",
      "In this example, you need to have a good understanding of the use case, the overall goal, \n",
      "and the end user to be able to find the right fit.\n",
      "Next, find out if the problem is even solvable using machine learning. Business leaders \n",
      "hear inspiring stories in the media about how a business solves a problem with ML and it \n",
      "sounds magical and the business leaders would love to use it to solve their business prob-\n",
      "lems. They need an expert like you to figure out if it is even feasible to solve their problem \n",
      "using ML. This is not as easy as it sounds; it depends on several things, like existing tech-\n",
      "nology, available data, and budget. For example, natural language processing has advanced \n",
      "leaps and bounds and has made it possible to do things that were impossible just a few years \n",
      "ago, such as using ML to answer a question from a piece of text. Familiarity with the lat-\n",
      "est advancements in natural language processing would help you identify easier, faster, and \n",
      "better ML methods to solve your business problems.\n",
      "As the next step, you will need to identify an ML learning approach that fits your \n",
      "use case.\n",

      "where students subscribe to courses. You have data of students’ activities and using this you \n",
      "want to improve the experience using machine learning. You could do several things:\n",
      " ■Create a recommendation engine to show new courses for students.\n",
      " ■Churn prediction to see if a student is going to quit the course.\n",
      " ■Churn prediction to see if a teacher is not going to come back.\n",
      " ■Identify what makes a course interesting for students (sample questions, more images, \n",
      "more tables, short videos, etc.).\n",
      " ■Identify what kind of learning a student prefers (auditory, visual, or kinesthetic).\n",
      "Which of these would be most impactful is a question that can be answered only by the \n",
      "business owner.\n",
      "Once you have identified the use case with the highest impact on your business, you need \n",
      "to identify the outcome of your machine learning solution. In short, what would happen if \n",
      "you implemented your solution? Sometimes, your model would make accurate predictions, \n",
      "but the environment might react in a counterproductive way to these predictions. This is \n",
      "because the environment is seldom static; the users could adapt or the users could get con-\n",
      "fused with the behavior of the predictions.\n",
      "For example, say your company has a video sharing website, and you have millions of \n",
      "videos. You are trying to build an ML model to recommend videos to your users. You could \n",
      "choose from among the following:\n",
      " ■An ML model to recommend unseen videos from popular video creators. The problem is \n",
      "that this is not personalized. What if the user does not like some of the creators?\n",
      " ■An ML model to recommend videos that get a lot of clicks. But what if these are just \n",
      "clickbait, where people click and regret wasting time?\n",
      " ■An ML model to recommend videos that have been watched fully by similar users. This \n",
      "would lead to improving the user experience.\n",
      "In this example, you need to have a good understanding of the use case, the overall goal, \n",
      "and the end user to be able to find the right fit.\n",
      "Next, find out if the problem is even solvable using machine learning. Business leaders \n",
      "hear inspiring stories in the media about how a business solves a problem with ML and it \n",
      "sounds magical and the business leaders would love to use it to solve their business prob-\n",
      "lems. They need an expert like you to figure out if it is even feasible to solve their problem \n",
      "using ML. This is not as easy as it sounds; it depends on several things, like existing tech-\n",
      "nology, available data, and budget. For example, natural language processing has advanced \n",
      "leaps and bounds and has made it possible to do things that were impossible just a few years \n",
      "ago, such as using ML to answer a question from a piece of text. Familiarity with the lat-\n",
      "est advancements in natural language processing would help you identify easier, faster, and \n",
      "better ML methods to solve your business problems.\n",
      "As the next step, you will need to identify an ML learning approach that fits your \n",
      "use case.\n",

      "Copyright © 2023. John Wiley & Sons, Incorporated. All rights reserved. Data collecting and cleaning is a major step in machine \n",
      "learning as your model is only as good as your data. Most of \n",
      "the time in machine learning is spent cleaning data and feature \n",
      "engineering. In this chapter, we will focus on data cleaning and exploratory data analysis \n",
      "(EDA). We will talk about data visualization and statistical techniques to check for bad data \n",
      "(omitted values, outliers, duplicate values). Then we will cover how to normalize the data \n",
      "and handle bad data (such as having a data schema), how to handle missing data, and how \n",
      "to check for data leakage. We will also cover how you can use TensorFlow Data Validation \n",
      "(TFDV) to validate data for large- scale systems.\n",
      "Visualization\n",
      "Data visualization is a data exploratory technique to find trends and outliers in the data. \n",
      "Data visualization helps in the data cleaning process because you can find out whether your \n",
      "data is imbalanced by visualizing the data on a chart. It also helps in the feature engineering \n",
      "process because you can select features and discard features and see how a feature will \n",
      "influence your model by visualizing it.\n",
      "There are two ways to visualize data:\n",
      "Univariate Analysis In this analysis, each of the features is analyzed independently, \n",
      "such as the range of the feature and whether outliers exist in the data. The most \n",
      "common visuals used for this are box plots and distribution plots.\n",
      "Bivariate Analysis In this analysis, we compare the data between two features. This \n",
      "analysis can be helpful in finding correlation between features. Some of the ways you \n",
      "can perform this analysis are by using line plots, bar plots, and scatterplots.\n",
      "Box Plot\n",
      "A box plot helps visualize the division of observations into defined intervals known as quar -\n",
      "tiles and how that compares to the entire observation. It represents the data as 25th, 50th, \n",
      "and 75th quartiles. It consists of the body, or interquartile range, where maximum observa-\n",
      "tions are present. Whiskers or straight lines represent the maximum and minimum. Points \n",
      "that lie outside the whiskers will be considered outliers.\n",

      "In statistics, we have three measures of central tendency: mean, median, and mode. They \n",

      "Mean\n",
      "Mean is the accurate measure to describe the data when we do not have any outliers present.\n",
      "Median\n",
      "Median is used if there is an outlier in the dataset. You can find the median by arranging \n",
      "data values from the lowest to the highest value.\n",
      "If there are even numbers, the median is the average of two numbers in the middle, and if \n",
      "there are odd numbers, the median is the middle value. For example, in the dataset 1, 1, 2, 4, \n",
      "6, 6, 9, the median is 4. For the dataset 1, 1, 4, 6, 6, 9, the median is 5. Take the mean of 4 \n",
      "and 6, or (4+6) / 2 = 5.\n",

      "Mode\n",
      "Mode is used if there is an outlier and the majority of the data is the same. Mode is the value \n",
      "or values in the dataset that occur most.\n",
      "For example, for the dataset 1, 1, 2, 5, 5, 5, 9, the mode is 5.\n",
      "Outlier Detection\n",
      "Mean is the measure of central tendency that is affected by the outliers, which in turn \n",
      "impacts standard deviation.\n",
      "For example, consider the following small dataset:\n",
      "[15, 18, 7, 13, 16, 11, 21, 5, 15, 10, 9, 210]\n",
      "By looking at it, one can quickly say 210 is an outlier that is much larger than the \n",
      "other values.\n",
      "As you can see from Table 2.1, there has been a significant change in mean by adding an \n",
      "outlier compared to median and mode. Variance is the average of the squared differences \n",
      "from the mean.\n",
      "Standard Deviation\n",
      "Standard deviation is the square root of the variance. Standard deviation is an excellent way \n",
      "to identify outliers. Data points that lie more than one standard deviation from the mean can \n",
      "be considered unusual.\n",
      "Covariance is a measure of how much two random variables vary from \n",

      "One of the methods of protecting data with multiple columns is to use an ML algorithm \n",
      "such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or other dimension- reducing techniques to \n",

      "use- of- principal- components- analysis- to- mask- sensitive- data-  \n",
      "in- machine- learning- 7904b01445d0 . For example, given three different fields \n",
      "of age, smoker (represented as 1 or 0), and body weight, the data might get condensed into a \n",
      "single PCA column that uses the following equation:\n",
      "1.5age + 30smoker + 0.2 * body- weight\n",
      "Somebody who is 20 years old, smokes, and weighs 140 pounds generates a value of 88. \n",
      "This is the same value generated by someone who is 30 years old, doesn’t smoke, and weighs \n",
      "215 pounds.\n",
      "This method can be quite robust because even if one identifies individuals who are unique \n",
      "in some way, it is hard to determine without an explanation of the PCA vector formula what \n",
      "makes them unique.\n",
      "Coarsening is another technique used to decrease the granularity of data in order to make \n",

      "Now, imagine you are being tasked with using ML to solve a problem. You first need to \n",
      "identify the use case and fit it to a machine learning problem.\n",
      "For example, say you are trying to predict house prices, you can use a regression model. \n",
      "The performance requirements of the model will be determined by the business.\n",
      "Say, you have had a discussion with the key people and understood the use case; you now \n",

      "can be executives, the CFO, data engineers, tech support staff who may have to approve the \n",
      "project to proceed. Each of these stakeholders might have very different expectations of this \n",
      "ML project, and your ability to communicate the value could make the difference between \n",

      "For example, say your company has a learning management system (LMS), a platform \n",
      "where students subscribe to courses. You have data of students’ activities and using this you \n",
      "want to improve the experience using machine learning. You could do several things:\n",
      " ■Create a recommendation engine to show new courses for students.\n",
      " ■Churn prediction to see if a student is going to quit the course.\n",
      " ■Churn prediction to see if a teacher is not going to come back.\n",
      " ■Identify what makes a course interesting for students (sample questions, more images, \n",
      "more tables, short videos, etc.).\n",
      " ■Identify what kind of learning a student prefers (auditory, visual, or kinesthetic).\n",
      "Which of these would be most impactful is a question that can be answered only by the \n",
      "business owner.\n",
      "Once you have identified the use case with the highest impact on your business, you need \n",
      "to identify the outcome of your machine learning solution. In short, what would happen if \n",
      "you implemented your solution? Sometimes, your model would make accurate predictions, \n",
      "but the environment might react in a counterproductive way to these predictions. This is \n",
      "because the environment is seldom static; the users could adapt or the users could get con-\n",
      "fused with the behavior of the predictions.\n",
      "For example, say your company has a video sharing website, and you have millions of \n",
      "videos. You are trying to build an ML model to recommend videos to your users. You could \n",
      "choose from among the following:\n",
      " ■An ML model to recommend unseen videos from popular video creators. The problem is \n",
      "that this is not personalized. What if the user does not like some of the creators?\n",
      " ■An ML model to recommend videos that get a lot of clicks. But what if these are just \n",
      "clickbait, where people click and regret wasting time?\n",
      " ■An ML model to recommend videos that have been watched fully by similar users. This \n",
      "would lead to improving the user experience.\n",
      "In this example, you need to have a good understanding of the use case, the overall goal, \n",
      "and the end user to be able to find the right fit.\n",
      "Next, find out if the problem is even solvable using machine learning. Business leaders \n",
      "hear inspiring stories in the media about how a business solves a problem with ML and it \n",
      "sounds magical and the business leaders would love to use it to solve their business prob-\n",
      "lems. They need an expert like you to figure out if it is even feasible to solve their problem \n",
      "using ML. This is not as easy as it sounds; it depends on several things, like existing tech-\n",
      "nology, available data, and budget. For example, natural language processing has advanced \n",
      "leaps and bounds and has made it possible to do things that were impossible just a few years \n",
      "ago, such as using ML to answer a question from a piece of text. Familiarity with the lat-\n",

      "of age, smoker (represented as 1 or 0), and body weight, the data might get condensed into a \n",
      "single PCA column that uses the following equation:\n",
      "1.5age + 30smoker + 0.2 * body- weight\n",
      "Somebody who is 20 years old, smokes, and weighs 140 pounds generates a value of 88. \n",
      "This is the same value generated by someone who is 30 years old, doesn’t smoke, and weighs \n",
      "215 pounds.\n",
      "This method can be quite robust because even if one identifies individuals who are unique \n",
      "in some way, it is hard to determine without an explanation of the PCA vector formula what \n",
      "makes them unique.\n",
      "Coarsening is another technique used to decrease the granularity of data in order to make \n",

      "One of the methods of protecting data with multiple columns is to use an ML algorithm \n",
      "such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or other dimension- reducing techniques to \n",
      "combine several features and then carry out ML training only on the resulting  \n",
      "PCA vectors, according to https://medium.com/lizuna/beacon- the-  \n",
      "use- of- principal- components- analysis- to- mask- sensitive- data-  \n",
      "in- machine- learning- 7904b01445d0 . For example, given three different fields \n",
      "of age, smoker (represented as 1 or 0), and body weight, the data might get condensed into a \n",
      "single PCA column that uses the following equation:\n",
      "1.5age + 30smoker + 0.2 * body- weight\n",
      "Somebody who is 20 years old, smokes, and weighs 140 pounds generates a value of 88. \n",
      "This is the same value generated by someone who is 30 years old, doesn’t smoke, and weighs \n",
      "215 pounds.\n",
      "This method can be quite robust because even if one identifies individuals who are unique \n",
      "in some way, it is hard to determine without an explanation of the PCA vector formula what \n",
      "makes them unique.\n",
      "Coarsening is another technique used to decrease the granularity of data in order to make \n",

      "Now, imagine you are being tasked with using ML to solve a problem. You first need to \n",

      "For example, say you are trying to predict house prices, you can use a regression model. \n",

      "Say, you have had a discussion with the key people and understood the use case; you now \n",

      "For example, say your company has a learning management system (LMS), a platform \n",
      "where students subscribe to courses. You have data of students’ activities and using this you \n",
      "want to improve the experience using machine learning. You could do several things:\n",
      " ■Create a recommendation engine to show new courses for students.\n",
      " ■Churn prediction to see if a student is going to quit the course.\n",
      " ■Churn prediction to see if a teacher is not going to come back.\n",
      " ■Identify what makes a course interesting for students (sample questions, more images, \n",
      "more tables, short videos, etc.).\n",
      " ■Identify what kind of learning a student prefers (auditory, visual, or kinesthetic).\n",
      "Which of these would be most impactful is a question that can be answered only by the \n",
      "business owner.\n",
      "Once you have identified the use case with the highest impact on your business, you need \n",
      "to identify the outcome of your machine learning solution. In short, what would happen if \n",
      "you implemented your solution? Sometimes, your model would make accurate predictions, \n",
      "but the environment might react in a counterproductive way to these predictions. This is \n",
      "because the environment is seldom static; the users could adapt or the users could get con-\n",
      "fused with the behavior of the predictions.\n",
      "For example, say your company has a video sharing website, and you have millions of \n",
      "videos. You are trying to build an ML model to recommend videos to your users. You could \n",
      "choose from among the following:\n",
      " ■An ML model to recommend unseen videos from popular video creators. The problem is \n",
      "that this is not personalized. What if the user does not like some of the creators?\n",
      " ■An ML model to recommend videos that get a lot of clicks. But what if these are just \n",
      "clickbait, where people click and regret wasting time?\n",
      " ■An ML model to recommend videos that have been watched fully by similar users. This \n",
      "would lead to improving the user experience.\n",
      "In this example, you need to have a good understanding of the use case, the overall goal, \n",
      "and the end user to be able to find the right fit.\n",
      "Next, find out if the problem is even solvable using machine learning. Business leaders \n",
      "hear inspiring stories in the media about how a business solves a problem with ML and it \n",
      "sounds magical and the business leaders would love to use it to solve their business prob-\n",
      "lems. They need an expert like you to figure out if it is even feasible to solve their problem \n",
      "using ML. This is not as easy as it sounds; it depends on several things, like existing tech-\n",
      "nology, available data, and budget. For example, natural language processing has advanced \n",
      "leaps and bounds and has made it possible to do things that were impossible just a few years \n",
      "ago, such as using ML to answer a question from a piece of text. Familiarity with the lat-\n",
      "est advancements in natural language processing would help you identify easier, faster, and \n",
      "better ML methods to solve your business problems.\n",
      "As the next step, you will need to identify an ML learning approach that fits your \n",

      "in- machine- learning- 7904b01445d0 . For example, given three different fields \n",
      "of age, smoker (represented as 1 or 0), and body weight, the data might get condensed into a \n",
      "single PCA column that uses the following equation:\n",
      "1.5age + 30smoker + 0.2 * body- weight\n",
      "Somebody who is 20 years old, smokes, and weighs 140 pounds generates a value of 88. \n",
      "This is the same value generated by someone who is 30 years old, doesn’t smoke, and weighs \n",
      "215 pounds.\n",

      "in some way, it is hard to determine without an explanation of the PCA vector formula what \n",

      "Coarsening is another technique used to decrease the granularity of data in order to make \n",

      "One of the methods of protecting data with multiple columns is to use an ML algorithm \n",
      "such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or other dimension- reducing techniques to \n",
      "combine several features and then carry out ML training only on the resulting  \n",
      "PCA vectors, according to https://medium.com/lizuna/beacon- the-  \n",
      "use- of- principal- components- analysis- to- mask- sensitive- data-  \n",
      "in- machine- learning- 7904b01445d0 . For example, given three different fields \n",
      "of age, smoker (represented as 1 or 0), and body weight, the data might get condensed into a \n",
      "single PCA column that uses the following equation:\n",
      "1.5age + 30smoker + 0.2 * body- weight\n",
      "Somebody who is 20 years old, smokes, and weighs 140 pounds generates a value of 88. \n",
      "This is the same value generated by someone who is 30 years old, doesn’t smoke, and weighs \n",
      "215 pounds.\n",
      "This method can be quite robust because even if one identifies individuals who are unique \n",
      "in some way, it is hard to determine without an explanation of the PCA vector formula what \n",
      "makes them unique.\n",
      "Coarsening is another technique used to decrease the granularity of data in order to make \n",
      "it more difficult to identify sensitive data within the dataset while still giving comparable \n",
      "benefits versus a training model with the pre- coarsened data. The fields in Table 6.3 are par -\n",

      "One of the methods of protecting data with multiple columns is to use an ML algorithm \n",

      "but the environment might react in a counterproductive way to these predictions. This is \n",
      "because the environment is seldom static; the users could adapt or the users could get con-\n",
      "fused with the behavior of the predictions.\n",
      "For example, say your company has a video sharing website, and you have millions of \n",
      "videos. You are trying to build an ML model to recommend videos to your users. You could \n",
      "choose from among the following:\n",
      " ■An ML model to recommend unseen videos from popular video creators. The problem is \n",
      "that this is not personalized. What if the user does not like some of the creators?\n",
      " ■An ML model to recommend videos that get a lot of clicks. But what if these are just \n",
      "clickbait, where people click and regret wasting time?\n",
      " ■An ML model to recommend videos that have been watched fully by similar users. This \n",
      "would lead to improving the user experience.\n",
      "In this example, you need to have a good understanding of the use case, the overall goal, \n",
      "and the end user to be able to find the right fit.\n",
      "Next, find out if the problem is even solvable using machine learning. Business leaders \n",
      "hear inspiring stories in the media about how a business solves a problem with ML and it \n",
      "sounds magical and the business leaders would love to use it to solve their business prob-\n",
      "lems. They need an expert like you to figure out if it is even feasible to solve their problem \n",
      "using ML. This is not as easy as it sounds; it depends on several things, like existing tech-\n",
      "nology, available data, and budget. For example, natural language processing has advanced \n",
      "leaps and bounds and has made it possible to do things that were impossible just a few years \n",
      "ago, such as using ML to answer a question from a piece of text. Familiarity with the lat-\n",
      "est advancements in natural language processing would help you identify easier, faster, and \n",

      "For example, say you are trying to predict house prices, you can use a regression model. \n",

      "For example, say your company has a learning management system (LMS), a platform \n",
      "where students subscribe to courses. You have data of students’ activities and using this you \n",
      "want to improve the experience using machine learning. You could do several things:\n",
      " ■Create a recommendation engine to show new courses for students.\n",
      " ■Churn prediction to see if a student is going to quit the course.\n",
      " ■Churn prediction to see if a teacher is not going to come back.\n",
      " ■Identify what makes a course interesting for students (sample questions, more images, \n",
      "more tables, short videos, etc.).\n",
      " ■Identify what kind of learning a student prefers (auditory, visual, or kinesthetic).\n",
      "Which of these would be most impactful is a question that can be answered only by the \n",
      "business owner.\n",
      "Once you have identified the use case with the highest impact on your business, you need \n",
      "to identify the outcome of your machine learning solution. In short, what would happen if \n",
      "you implemented your solution? Sometimes, your model would make accurate predictions, \n",
      "but the environment might react in a counterproductive way to these predictions. This is \n",
      "because the environment is seldom static; the users could adapt or the users could get con-\n",
      "fused with the behavior of the predictions.\n",
      "For example, say your company has a video sharing website, and you have millions of \n",
      "videos. You are trying to build an ML model to recommend videos to your users. You could \n",
      "choose from among the following:\n",
      " ■An ML model to recommend unseen videos from popular video creators. The problem is \n",
      "that this is not personalized. What if the user does not like some of the creators?\n",
      " ■An ML model to recommend videos that get a lot of clicks. But what if these are just \n",
      "clickbait, where people click and regret wasting time?\n",
      " ■An ML model to recommend videos that have been watched fully by similar users. This \n",
      "would lead to improving the user experience.\n",
      "In this example, you need to have a good understanding of the use case, the overall goal, \n",
      "and the end user to be able to find the right fit.\n",
      "Next, find out if the problem is even solvable using machine learning. Business leaders \n",
      "hear inspiring stories in the media about how a business solves a problem with ML and it \n",
      "sounds magical and the business leaders would love to use it to solve their business prob-\n",
      "lems. They need an expert like you to figure out if it is even feasible to solve their problem \n",
      "using ML. This is not as easy as it sounds; it depends on several things, like existing tech-\n",
      "nology, available data, and budget. For example, natural language processing has advanced \n",
      "leaps and bounds and has made it possible to do things that were impossible just a few years \n",
      "ago, such as using ML to answer a question from a piece of text. Familiarity with the lat-\n",
      "est advancements in natural language processing would help you identify easier, faster, and \n",
      "better ML methods to solve your business problems.\n",

      "times, a use case will fit perfectly with an ML framework and other times not so well. You \n",

      "fairly new. There are hundreds if not thousands of ways to apply machine learning tech-\n",
      "niques. To help us get a grasp of the breadth of these methods, we organize them into cate-\n",
      "gories (also called methods, or types or approaches or problems). Each of these approaches \n",
      "solves a specific class of problems, distinguished by the type of data, the type of prediction, \n",
      "and so on.\n",
      "On the exam, you will be given the details of a use case and will be \n",

      "priate machine learning approach to solve it. To accomplish that, you \n",
      "need to have wide knowledge of the landscape of these machine learning \n",
      "approaches.\n",
      "We will look at the different ways to classify the approaches in the following sections.\n",
      "Supervised, Unsupervised, and Semi- supervised  \n",
      "Learning\n",
      "A common method of classifying machine learning approaches is based on the type of \n",
      "learning. When you have a labeled dataset that you can use to train your model, it is called \n",
      "supervised learning. For example, supervised learning would be trying to build a model to \n",
      "classify images of dogs or cats and having the ability to use a dataset of images that have \n",
      "been labeled accordingly.\n",
      "There are some cases where you have only unlabeled data, such as a set of images \n",
      "(without any labels or tags), and you will be asked to classify or group them. This would be \n",
      "an unsupervised ML model. Clustering algorithms are a suite of algorithms that belong to \n",
      "this type and are used to group and/or classify data. Autoencoders are also a family of algo-\n",
      "rithms that belong to this type. Autoencoders are used to reduce the dimensionality of input \n",
      "data, a preprocessing step in many machine learning models.\n",
      "Another popular unsupervised ML use case is topic modeling, a type of document clus-\n",
      "tering problem. The algorithm takes documents and classifies them into N number of classes \n",
      "based on the commonality of words and sentences in the texts. Comparing this to how \n",
      "a human being would classify books, say, in a library, you may classify them into fiction, \n",
      "nonfiction, science, history, and so on. In other times, you may classify the books based on \n",
      "languages (for example, English, Chinese, Hindi). Similarly, an unsupervised algorithm may \n",

      "Forecasting is another type where the input is time-series data and the model predicts \n",

      "Some forecasting problems can be converted to regression problems by modifying the \n",
