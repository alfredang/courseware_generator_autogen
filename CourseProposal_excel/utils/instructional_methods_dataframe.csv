Instructional Method,Description
Classroom,"Lecture is an instructional method commonly used by facilitators to impart knowledge to their learners. A lecture is a prepared oral presentation on a given topic. Lectures comprise content delivery supported by examples to illustrate principles and concepts. The content is generally not lengthy and combines other presentation and application methods. The activities for the lecture include presentation, slideshow and note-taking. 

Lecturing is an inevitable part of classroom learning. It allows the facilitator to deliver information to learners as planned. This gives excellent control over what is taught and lets the facilitator be the sole source of information to avoid confusion. 

The facilitator can present the material during the lecture and answer learners' questions. Learners can receive, take in and respond. This enhances a well-organised pattern of ideas, enabling learners to better grasp the principles and concepts."
Didactic Questioning,"Didactic questioning can ensure learners follow the presentation and understand the concepts. 

Didactic questioning follows a pre-determined set of questions to lead learners to certain realisations or conclusions or to help them meet a specific learning outcome."
Demonstration,"Demonstration is an effective instructional method used by facilitators to show learners how to perform specific tasks or complete processes. It is a visual and hands-on approach that can teach various subjects and skills.

The use of demonstration in teaching has several benefits, including:
â€¢ It gives learners a clear and concrete example of performing a task or completing a process.
â€¢ It allows learners to see the results of their work in real-time, which can be motivating and rewarding.
â€¢ It encourages active participation and engagement from learners, which can help to improve learning outcomes.

It helps learners to understand complex concepts and processes by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable steps."
Practical,"Practical is an instructional method that allows learners to apply what they have learned in a real-world context, which can help reinforce their understanding of the material.

The use of the practice in teaching has several benefits, including:
â€¢ It can help to reinforce learning by providing learners with feedback on their performance and identifying areas where they need to improve.
â€¢ It helps learners develop their skills and knowledge by providing opportunities to apply what they have learned in a real-world context.
â€¢ It can help build learnersâ€™ confidence by allowing them to practice and refine their skills.
â€¢ It can help to prepare learners for future challenges by providing them with the skills and knowledge they need to succeed."
