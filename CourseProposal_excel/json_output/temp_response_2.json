            "What are the performance gaps in the industry?": "Another significant performance gap is the lack of collaboration among security teams when assessing risks. Often, security personnel work in silos, which can lead to incomplete risk evaluations and missed opportunities for addressing vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the absence of established methods for risk analysis can hinder the effectiveness of security operations, leaving organizations exposed to potential threats.",
            "Why do you think this WSQ course will address the training needs for the industry?": "The course emphasizes the importance of teamwork and collaboration in risk assessment processes. By engaging with peers and security teams, participants will develop a comprehensive understanding of established risk analysis methods, enabling them to work more effectively together to identify and address security deficiencies."
