      "What are the performance gaps in the industry?": "One of the key performance gaps in the industry is the inability to effectively identify and respond to potential security threats. Many organizations struggle with recognizing tell-tale signs of suspicious activities or behaviors, which can lead to inadequate security measures. Additionally, there is often a lack of systematic procedures for conducting thorough site assessments, resulting in vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors. This gap in risk identification and assessment can compromise the safety and security of both personnel and assets.",

      "What are the performance gaps in the industry?": "A critical gap in the industry is the insufficient training in recognizing and responding to environmental factors that may pose security risks. Many security professionals lack the knowledge of how to assess the suitability of existing security systems and identify deficiencies that could lead to breaches. This lack of awareness can result in inadequate responses to evolving threats and vulnerabilities.",
      "Why do you think this WSQ course will address the training needs for the industry?": "This course provides in-depth knowledge on assessing security systems and identifying potential deficiencies. By equipping participants with the skills to analyze environmental factors and their impact on security, the course will enhance their ability to recommend appropriate measures to mitigate risks effectively."
