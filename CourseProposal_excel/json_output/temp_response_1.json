            "What are the performance gaps in the industry?": "One of the key performance gaps in the industry is the inability to effectively identify and respond to potential security threats. Many organizations struggle with recognizing tell-tale signs of suspicious activities or behaviors, which can lead to inadequate security measures. Additionally, there is often a lack of systematic procedures for conducting thorough site assessments, resulting in vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors. This gap in risk identification and assessment can compromise the safety and security of both personnel and assets.",

By focusing on systematic assessment methods, participants will learn to recognize and analyze suspicious behaviors and activities, thereby improving their ability to mitigate risks effectively."
