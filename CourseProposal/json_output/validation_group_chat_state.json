Personnel often struggle to recognize subtle indicators of impending security breaches, leading to delayed responses and increased vulnerability. This reactive approach hinders the ability to effectively mitigate risks before they escalate into serious incidents. Furthermore, there is inconsistency in applying standardized procedures when assessing and responding to potential threats.\",\n            \"Why do you think this WSQ course will address the training needs for the industry?\": \"This course equips individuals with the skills to observe and interpret initial signs of potential security threats, thus enabling earlier detection. By familiarizing participants with organizational protocols, it ensures standardized, consistent reactions when risks are identified. This proactive strategy allows for the mitigation of potential issues before they evolve into full-scale problems, safeguarding assets and maintaining operational integrity through improved responses to suspicious activities.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"What are the performance gaps in the industry?\": \"One critical area needing improvement is the consistent application of security protocols across various operational settings. Differing interpretations and adherence to procedures can create vulnerabilities exploited by malicious actors. A lack of consistent protocol application leads to confusion and ineffective response during critical moments. Personnel also sometimes miss crucial details when identifying threats due to lack of experience.\",\n            \"Why do you think this WSQ course will address the training needs for the industry?\": \"The course provides participants with a structured approach to identifying risks, leveraging both theoretical knowledge and practical experience, and will help to learn to recognize potential threats within organizational procedures. Emphasis is placed on analyzing diverse scenarios, which fosters an environment for experience-based judgement to promote proactive risk management, thereby decreasing security lapses from inconsistent implementations.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"What are the performance gaps in the industry?\": \"A notable deficiency lies in the ability to thoroughly analyze security situations and apply prior experiences to new, evolving threats.
