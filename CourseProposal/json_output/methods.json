    "Assessment Methods": {
        "Lectures": "Lecture is an instructional method commonly used by facilitators to impart knowledge to their learners. A lecture is a prepared oral presentation on a given topic. Lectures comprise content delivery supported by examples to illustrate principles and concepts. The content is generally not lengthy and combines other presentation and application methods. The activities for the lecture include presentation, slideshow and note-taking. Lecturing is an inevitable part of classroom learning. It allows the facilitator to deliver information to learners as planned. This gives excellent control over what is taught and lets the facilitator be the sole source of information to avoid confusion. The facilitator can present the material during the lecture and answer learners' questions. Learners can receive, take in and respond. This enhances a well-organised pattern of ideas, enabling learners to better grasp the principles and concepts.",
        
        "Didactic Questioning": "Didactic questioning ensures learners follow the presentation and understand the concepts. It follows a pre-determined set of questions to lead learners to specific realisations or conclusions.",
      
        "Demonstration": "Demonstration is a visual and hands-on approach used by facilitators to show learners how to perform tasks or complete processes. It gives learners a clear example of performing tasks, allows them to see real-time results, encourages active participation, and helps learners understand complex concepts by breaking them down.",
      
        "Practical": "Practical learning allows learners to apply knowledge in a real-world context, reinforcing understanding. It provides feedback on performance, helps learners develop skills, and builds learners' confidence by practicing and refining skills.",
      
        "Case Study": "Learners analyze a written account of a work situation and present findings and recommendations. Case studies help relate principles and concepts to concrete examples.",
      
        "Peer Sharing": "Peer sharing involves learners sharing ideas, experiences, and perspectives in a structured, facilitated manner. It fosters a collaborative learning environment where learners retain content and learn from each other.",
      
        "Group Discussion": "An exchange of ideas on a topic in a group size of 5 pax, either unstructured or structured. Facilitators manage the flow of the discussion to ensure productivity and focus, enhancing learners' understanding of learned material.",
      
        "Brainstorming": "Learners brainstorm possible ideas to solve a problem in groups of 2 to 4 learners. After brainstorming, the ideas are discussed, ranked, and evaluated to solve the problem.",
      
        "Concept Formation": "Concept formation refers to a higher-order mental process that organizes perceived information into conceptual categories for reasoning, problem-solving, and planning.",
      
        "Quiz": "Quizzes are tools to assess and enhance learning by evaluating learners' understanding of subject matter. They provide feedback on comprehension, reinforce learned material, and stimulate engagement. They can be adapted to different learning styles.",
      
        "Role Play": "Learners simulate real-life scenarios to apply learning concepts in a low-risk setting. After the role-play, a debrief is conducted where learners reflect on what worked well and areas for improvement.",
      
        "Lectures (Synchronous)": "Synchronous lectures are real-time oral presentations delivered via platforms like Zoom, allowing interaction between learners and the facilitator. Learners receive login credentials via email and attend the session virtually.",
      
        "Group Discussion (Synchronous)": "Synchronous group discussions take place in breakout rooms via Zoom. Facilitators manage the flow of conversation to ensure focus and productivity while learners exchange ideas on a topic.",
      
        "Role Play (Synchronous)": "Synchronous role play involves learners acting out scenarios in real-time via Zoom. The facilitator explains the scenario, assigns roles, and debriefs participants afterward to reflect on the experience.",
      
        "Asynchronous e-learning": "Asynchronous e-learning is self-paced and supported by an LMS. Learners access materials like slides and videos and complete assessments in their own time, allowing flexibility when participants cannot be online simultaneously."

    "Instructional Methods":{
        "Lectures": "Written Assessment - Short-Answer Questions (WA-SAQ) assessment will provide direct evidence of whether the candidates have acquired the underlying knowledge through written questions and answers Written Assessment - Short-Answer Questions (WA-SAQ) assessment consists of open-ended questions that require candidates to create an answer to each question. It is effective for assessing the knowledge of a topic.
Type of Evidence: Written responses to short-answer questions.
Manner of Submission: Candidates will generate answers to the questions and submit the hardcopy to the assessor.
Marking Process: Assessors will evaluate the written responses on the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the answers.
Retention Period: 3 years.",
