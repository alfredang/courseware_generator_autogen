    "course_overview": {
      "course_description": "This course provides a comprehensive introduction to Git and GitHub, focusing on software configuration and collaborative development practices for beginner learners. Participants will learn to manage repositories, create branches, and integrate software products using appropriate Git scripts. The course emphasizes practical application through hands-on exercises covering repository management, issue tracking, and pull requests, ensuring learners can effectively collaborate on software projects. \n\nFurthermore, the course explores modern development tools such as GitHub Actions, Copilot, and Codespaces to automate workflows and enhance productivity. Learners will also gain essential skills in security and administration, including dependency management, code scanning, and user authentication. By mastering these skills, participants will improve their ability to diagnose configuration issues, optimize deployment processes, and contribute to secure and efficient software development, increasing their employment and job upgrading opportunities."
