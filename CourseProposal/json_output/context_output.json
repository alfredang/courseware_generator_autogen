        "SkillsFuture's report Skills Demand For The Future Economy (https://www.skillsfuture.gov.sg/skillsreport) published in 2025, spotlights the priority skills and jobs in demand in three specially selected, emerging, high-growth areas. This report is designed for Singaporeans as a resource for an individual\u2019s skills development journey over the next one to three years.  Singapore's key growth areas (Digital, Green & Care Economy) bring exciting job and skills opportunities. It also introduced the idea of 'priority skills, ' highly transferable skills across job roles within the three economies. In other words, these skills are applicable in many job roles and will contribute significantly to the individual's long-term career versatility. A new dimension on skills demands growth has been added and analysed alongside skills transferability. Demand growth captures the relative scale of the increase in demand for that skill, while transferability captures the scope of the skill's applicability across different job roles. The two-dimensional analysis seeks to provide deeper insights to the reader into the nature of the priority skills identified. \n\nThe industry faces significant challenges in maintaining robust security risk analysis practices due to evolving threat landscapes and increasing sophistication of security breaches. One major performance gap stems from the difficulty in adapting traditional security measures to modern, dynamic environments. Many security professionals struggle to identify and assess risks associated with emerging technologies and cyber-physical systems, leading to vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure and sensitive data. Furthermore, there's often a disconnect between theoretical risk assessments and practical implementation, where security protocols are either inadequately enforced or fail to address the specific needs and contexts of different operational settings. This is compounded by a shortage of skilled personnel capable of conducting comprehensive risk analyses and translating them into actionable security plans. The reliance on outdated methodologies and a lack of continuous professional development also contribute to the stagnation of risk analysis capabilities within organizations. The absence of effective communication and collaboration between security teams and other departments results in fragmented security efforts, where risks are not holistically addressed across the entire organization. The increasing regulatory requirements and compliance standards further exacerbate these challenges, as organizations struggle to keep pace with the evolving legal landscape and implement adequate measures to ensure compliance. Ultimately, these gaps result in increased vulnerability to security incidents, financial losses, and reputational damage.\n\nAnother critical challenge is the human element in security breaches. Employees, whether through negligence or lack of awareness, often become the weakest link in an organization's security chain. Social engineering attacks, phishing scams, and insider threats exploit human vulnerabilities, bypassing even the most sophisticated technological defenses. Many organizations fail to provide adequate training to their employees on recognizing and responding to these threats, leading to a higher susceptibility to security breaches. Additionally, the rapid adoption of remote work arrangements has further complicated security efforts, as employees may use unsecured networks and devices, increasing the risk of data leaks and unauthorized access. The lack of clear policies and procedures for remote work, coupled with insufficient monitoring and enforcement, creates significant vulnerabilities. Moreover, the increasing complexity of IT systems and networks makes it difficult for security professionals to identify and address potential vulnerabilities. The proliferation of interconnected devices and cloud-based services expands the attack surface, providing more opportunities for malicious actors to exploit weaknesses. The lack of automation and integration in security tools hinders the ability to detect and respond to threats in a timely manner. As a result, organizations often struggle to maintain a proactive security posture and are forced to react to incidents after they have already occurred. The financial constraints faced by many organizations also limit their ability to invest in advanced security technologies and training programs, further exacerbating the challenges.\n\nFinally, the integration of physical and cybersecurity domains presents a unique set of challenges. Traditionally, these domains have operated in silos, with separate teams and security protocols. However, modern threats often blur the lines between physical and cyber realms, requiring a more holistic and integrated approach to security. For example, a physical security breach could be used to gain access to an organization's network, or a cyberattack could disrupt physical security systems such as surveillance cameras and access control systems. Many organizations lack the expertise and resources to effectively integrate these two domains, leading to gaps in security coverage. The lack of coordination and communication between physical and cybersecurity teams hinders the ability to respond effectively to incidents that span both domains. Additionally, the increasing use of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in physical security systems introduces new vulnerabilities, as these devices are often poorly secured and can be easily compromised. The absence of standardized security protocols for IoT devices further complicates the integration of physical and cybersecurity domains. As a result, organizations must address these challenges by fostering collaboration between different teams, implementing integrated security solutions, and developing comprehensive security strategies that encompass both physical and cyber aspects.\n\nTo address the identified performance gaps, comprehensive training programs are essential to equip security professionals with the necessary skills and knowledge. Firstly, training should focus on enhancing the ability to identify and assess emerging threats, including those related to cyber-physical systems, IoT devices, and cloud-based services. This involves providing in-depth knowledge of current threat actors, their tactics, and the vulnerabilities they exploit. Hands-on exercises and simulations can help participants develop practical skills in threat identification and risk assessment. Secondly, training should emphasize the importance of translating risk assessments into actionable security plans. This includes teaching participants how to develop and implement security policies, procedures, and controls that are tailored to the specific needs and contexts of different operational settings. The training should also cover the principles of security architecture and design, enabling participants to create robust and resilient security systems. Furthermore, training programs must address the human element in security breaches. This involves providing employees with comprehensive training on recognizing and responding to social engineering attacks, phishing scams, and insider threats. The training should also cover the importance of data privacy and security best practices. Regular refresher courses and awareness campaigns can help reinforce these concepts and keep employees up-to-date on the latest threats.\n\nIn addition to technical skills, training should also focus on developing soft skills such as communication, collaboration, and critical thinking. Security professionals must be able to effectively communicate risk assessments and security plans to stakeholders across the organization, including senior management, IT staff, and end-users. They must also be able to collaborate effectively with different teams to ensure that security efforts are coordinated and aligned. Critical thinking skills are essential for analyzing complex security scenarios and making informed decisions. Furthermore, training should cover the latest regulatory requirements and compliance standards. This includes providing participants with a thorough understanding of relevant laws and regulations, as well as best practices for achieving compliance. The training should also cover the principles of security auditing and assessment, enabling participants to evaluate the effectiveness of security controls and identify areas for improvement. The training should be continuously updated to reflect the evolving regulatory landscape. Moreover, training programs should incorporate real-world case studies and simulations to provide participants with practical experience in dealing with security incidents. This includes simulating different types of attacks, such as ransomware, data breaches, and denial-of-service attacks, and providing participants with the opportunity to respond to these incidents in a controlled environment. The training should also cover the principles of incident response and recovery, enabling participants to develop effective incident response plans and procedures.\n\nFinally, training should address the integration of physical and cybersecurity domains. This involves providing participants with a comprehensive understanding of the interdependencies between these two domains and the potential risks that arise from their integration. The training should also cover the principles of converged security management, enabling participants to develop and implement security strategies that encompass both physical and cyber aspects. Furthermore, training should focus on developing the skills necessary to integrate security tools and technologies across physical and cyber domains. This includes integrating video surveillance systems with intrusion detection systems, and integrating access control systems with identity management systems. The training should also cover the principles of security information and event management (SIEM), enabling participants to collect and analyze security data from different sources to detect and respond to threats. Continuous professional development is crucial to keep security professionals abreast of the latest threats and technologies. This includes providing opportunities for ongoing training, certifications, and participation in industry conferences and events. Organizations should also encourage security professionals to pursue advanced degrees and certifications in relevant fields such as cybersecurity, risk management, and information security.\n\nNumerous job roles across various sectors would significantly benefit from enhanced capabilities in security risk analysis. Primarily, security managers and officers responsible for overseeing security operations and implementing security measures would gain substantial advantages. This training equips them with the tools and knowledge to conduct thorough site assessments, identify vulnerabilities, and develop effective risk mitigation strategies.
