        {
            "What are the performance gaps in the industry?": "Within the sector, a significant gap exists in the proactive identification of potential threats. Personnel often struggle to recognize subtle indicators of impending security breaches, leading to delayed responses and increased vulnerability. This reactive approach hinders the ability to effectively mitigate risks before they escalate into serious incidents. Furthermore, there is inconsistency in applying standardized procedures when assessing and responding to potential threats.",
            "Why do you think this WSQ course will address the training needs for the industry?": "This course equips individuals with the skills to observe and interpret initial signs of potential security threats, thus enabling earlier detection. By familiarizing participants with organizational protocols, it ensures standardized, consistent reactions when risks are identified. This proactive strategy allows for the mitigation of potential issues before they evolve into full-scale problems, safeguarding assets and maintaining operational integrity through improved responses to suspicious activities."
