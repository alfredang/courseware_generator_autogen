One of the primary performance gaps is the lack of skilled professionals who can establish high-level structures and frameworks for Kubernetes applications. Many organizations struggle with aligning technical, functional, and service requirements within their Kubernetes-based architectures, leading to inefficient deployments and increased operational costs. Additionally, there is often a disconnect between the various components of Kubernetes solutions, resulting in compatibility issues that hinder the overall performance and scalability of applications. The rapid evolution of cloud-native technologies and the increasing complexity of application environments further exacerbate these challenges, as teams may not be adequately trained to handle the nuances of Kubernetes, such as multi-container Pod design patterns and the use of Helm for package management. Furthermore, organizations frequently face difficulties in articulating the value of their Kubernetes solutions, particularly in terms of coding standards, scalability, and reusability, which can lead to underutilization of resources and missed opportunities for optimization.\",\n        \"Training needs necessary to address these gaps\": \"To address the identified performance gaps, there is a pressing need for targeted training programs that equip professionals with the necessary skills and knowledge to effectively design, deploy, and maintain Kubernetes applications. Training should focus on establishing high-level frameworks and structures that guide the development of IT solutions, incorporating various processes, hardware, and software components. Participants need to be trained in the application of tools and modeling techniques that are essential for creating robust solution architectures. Additionally, training must emphasize the importance of aligning the requirements of various stakeholders and ensuring compatibility among multiple solution architecture components. Practical training sessions that include hands-on experience with Kubernetes primitives, deployment strategies, and application observability techniques will be crucial in building confidence and competence among participants. Furthermore, establishing processes for regular monitoring, testing, and reviewing of solution architectures against business requirements will empower professionals to validate their Kubernetes implementations effectively. Overall, a comprehensive training approach that combines theoretical knowledge with practical application is essential to bridge the skills gap in the industry.\",\n        \"Job roles that would benefit from the training\": \"Several job roles within the Infocomm Technology sector would significantly benefit from this training. Kubernetes application developers, who are responsible for designing and building applications that run on Kubernetes, would gain valuable insights into best practices for application design and deployment. Solution architects would also benefit, as they need to align technical and functional requirements within Kubernetes-based architectures and ensure compatibility among various components. DevOps engineers, who play a critical role in the continuous integration and deployment of applications, would find the training particularly beneficial in understanding how to implement effective deployment strategies and maintain application observability. Additionally, system administrators and IT operations personnel would enhance their skills in managing Kubernetes environments, focusing on security, configuration, and resource management.
