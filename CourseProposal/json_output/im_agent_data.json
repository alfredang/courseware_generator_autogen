    "Classroom": "The classroom setting is essential for delivering structured lessons and facilitating direct interaction between the facilitator and the learners. This approach allows for the systematic presentation of key principles and concepts. The controlled environment ensures that learners receive consistent information, which is critical for grasping the foundational knowledge required for understanding risk analysis techniques, organisational procedures, and the identification of potential security threats.",
    "Peer Sharing": "Peer sharing enables learners to benefit from diverse perspectives and experiences related to security risk analysis. By discussing their own insights and observations in small groups, learners can gain a more comprehensive understanding of how different individuals might perceive and react to various security scenarios. This collaborative approach encourages critical thinking and helps learners refine their ability to identify and assess security risks.",
    "Group Discussion": "Group discussions provide a platform for learners to collectively explore the complexities of security risk analysis. By engaging in structured conversations, learners can challenge each other's assumptions, share best practices, and develop a deeper understanding of the various factors that contribute to security vulnerabilities. This collaborative approach fosters a sense of shared responsibility and encourages learners to think critically about the challenges and opportunities associated with security risk management.",
    "Case Study": "The case study methodology allows learners to apply their knowledge and skills to real-world security scenarios. By analysing detailed case studies, learners can develop their ability to identify potential threats, assess risks, and recommend appropriate security measures. This practical approach helps learners bridge the gap between theory and practice, ensuring they are well-prepared to address the challenges of security risk analysis in their professional roles."
