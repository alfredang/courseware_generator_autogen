        "SkillsFuture's report Skills Demand For The Future Economy (https://www.skillsfuture.gov.sg/skillsreport) published in 2025, spotlights the priority skills and jobs in demand in three specially selected, emerging, high-growth areas. This report is designed for Singaporeans as a resource for an individual\u2019s skills development journey over the next one to three years.  Singapore's key growth areas (Digital, Green & Care Economy) bring exciting job and skills opportunities. It also introduced the idea of 'priority skills, ' highly transferable skills across job roles within the three economies. In other words, these skills are applicable in many job roles and will contribute significantly to the individual's long-term career versatility. A new dimension on skills demands growth has been added and analysed alongside skills transferability. Demand growth captures the relative scale of the increase in demand for that skill, while transferability captures the scope of the skill's applicability across different job roles. The two-dimensional analysis seeks to provide deeper insights to the reader into the nature of the priority skills identified. \n\nThe industry is currently facing significant challenges and performance gaps, particularly in integrating advanced technologies like generative AI into traditional storytelling and storyboarding processes. One of the primary challenges is the rapid pace of technological advancement, which has outstripped the ability of many professionals to keep up with new tools and methodologies. This has created a gap in skills, where many practitioners are not fully equipped to leverage generative AI to its fullest potential. Additionally, there is a growing concern about the ethical implications of using AI in creative processes, including issues related to bias, copyright infringement, and plagiarism. These ethical concerns are compounded by a lack of comprehensive understanding and training on how to address them effectively. Furthermore, the industry is experiencing a shift in consumer expectations, with audiences increasingly demanding more personalized and engaging content, which requires a deep understanding of both storytelling principles and the technical capabilities of AI. This gap between consumer expectations and current industry capabilities highlights the need for targeted training to bridge these divides and enhance the overall quality and effectiveness of media content produced using AI technologies.\n\nTo address the identified challenges and performance gaps, there is a critical need for comprehensive training programs that focus on both the technical and creative aspects of using generative AI in storytelling and storyboarding. Training should cover the fundamentals of AI-generated content creation, including script ideation techniques, narrative structure, and character development, to ensure that professionals can create compelling and engaging stories. Additionally, there is a need for training on the ethical use of AI, including understanding and mitigating bias in AI outputs, adhering to copyright laws, and implementing best practices to minimize plagiarism risks. This training should also include practical, hands-on experience with AI tools to allow participants to experiment with and refine their skills in a controlled environment. Furthermore, training programs should emphasize the importance of iterative processes in content creation, teaching participants how to apply and adjust prompts to improve the quality of AI-generated outputs. By providing a balanced approach that combines technical proficiency with creative storytelling and ethical considerations, training programs can equip industry professionals with the skills necessary to meet the evolving demands of the sector and produce high-quality, innovative content.\n\nSeveral job roles within the industry would significantly benefit from training in generative AI for storytelling and storyboarding. Scriptwriters and content creators, for instance, would gain valuable skills in using AI to enhance their creative processes, allowing them to develop more engaging and personalized narratives. Storyboard artists and visual designers would also benefit from understanding how to integrate AI-generated elements into their work, improving the efficiency and quality of visual storytelling. Additionally, video producers and editors could leverage AI tools to streamline video content creation, from script development to final production, enhancing both the speed and quality of their outputs. Furthermore, roles such as content strategists and creative directors would benefit from a deeper understanding of AI capabilities and limitations, enabling them to make informed decisions about incorporating AI into their projects. Finally, legal and compliance professionals within the industry would benefit from training on the ethical and legal implications of using AI, ensuring that their organizations adhere to best practices and avoid potential legal pitfalls. By targeting these key roles, training programs can help bridge the skills gap and drive innovation across the industry."
