        "The agriculture sector, particularly urban farming, faces significant challenges that hinder optimal performance and productivity. One of the primary issues is the lack of knowledge and skills among practitioners regarding modern farming techniques, particularly hydroponics. Many individuals involved in urban farming may not be familiar with the various hydroponic systems, their setup, and maintenance, leading to inefficient operations and lower crop yields. Additionally, the industry is often plagued by insufficient adherence to regulatory frameworks and best practices, resulting in non-compliance with food safety standards and workplace safety protocols. This lack of compliance not only jeopardizes the health of consumers but also exposes farmers to legal liabilities and financial penalties. Furthermore, the rapid urbanization and limited space in urban environments create additional pressure on urban farmers to maximize output while minimizing resource use, which requires a thorough understanding of advanced farming techniques and sustainability practices. The performance gaps are further exacerbated by the need for ongoing education and training, as many existing practitioners may not have access to updated information on emerging technologies and practices within the hydroponics sector.\n\nTo effectively address the identified performance gaps, targeted training programs focusing on hydroponics and urban farming practices are essential. Such training should encompass a comprehensive curriculum that covers the types, purposes, and functions of farming equipment and machinery, as well as the standard operating procedures (SOPs) necessary for efficient farming operations. Additionally, training must emphasize the importance of Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs) and compliance with prevailing regulations concerning food safety and workplace safety and health (WSH) practices. Practitioners need hands-on experience in setting up and maintaining hydroponic systems, which should be integrated into the training through practical demonstrations and real-world applications. Moreover, training programs should also include modules on equipment cleaning and maintenance techniques to ensure that farming operations are conducted in a hygienic and safe manner. By equipping urban farmers with the necessary skills and knowledge, the training can significantly enhance their ability to perform farming activities effectively, comply with regulations, and maintain high standards of food safety, ultimately leading to improved productivity and sustainability in urban agriculture.\n\nSeveral job roles within the agriculture sector, particularly those focused on urban farming and hydroponics, would greatly benefit from the proposed training. Urban farmers, who are directly involved in planting, cultivating, and harvesting crops, would gain valuable insights into the best practices for hydroponics, enabling them to enhance their operational efficiency and output. Additionally, farm managers and supervisors, who oversee the daily operations of urban farms, would benefit from understanding the regulatory frameworks and compliance requirements essential for maintaining safe and productive farming environments. Agricultural technicians and support staff, who assist in the maintenance and operation of farming equipment, would also find the training beneficial as it would equip them with the necessary skills to ensure that equipment is properly cleaned and maintained, thereby reducing the risk of operational downtime. Furthermore, individuals looking to enter the urban farming sector, such as aspiring entrepreneurs or community gardeners, would find the training invaluable as it provides a solid foundation in hydroponics and urban farming practices, preparing them for successful careers in this growing industry. Overall, the training would cater to a diverse range of roles within the urban farming sector, fostering a more knowledgeable and skilled workforce capable of addressing the challenges faced by the industry."
