            "What are the performance gaps in the industry?": "One critical area needing improvement is the consistent application of security protocols across various operational settings. Differing interpretations and adherence to procedures can create vulnerabilities exploited by malicious actors. A lack of consistent protocol application leads to confusion and ineffective response during critical moments. Personnel also sometimes miss crucial details when identifying threats due to lack of experience.",
            "Why do you think this WSQ course will address the training needs for the industry?": "The course provides participants with a structured approach to identifying risks, leveraging both theoretical knowledge and practical experience, and will help to learn to recognize potential threats within organizational procedures. Emphasis is placed on analyzing diverse scenarios, which fosters an environment for experience-based judgement to promote proactive risk management, thereby decreasing security lapses from inconsistent implementations."
