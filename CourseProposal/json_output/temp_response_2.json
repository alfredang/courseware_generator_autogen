        {
            "What are the performance gaps in the industry?": "A significant challenge lies in aligning technical requirements with actual business needs. Many solutions are implemented without fully considering stakeholder requirements, resulting in misaligned architectures that fail to deliver the expected value. This disconnect often leads to costly rework and missed opportunities.",
            "Why do you think this WSQ course will address the training needs for the industry?": "The course emphasizes aligning requirements from various stakeholders, including internal and external parties, ensuring that the solutions meet technical, functional, and service demands. Participants will learn how to implement effective deployment strategies and utilize tools like Helm, which contributes to a smoother alignment process, resulting in solutions that are more relevant and impactful."
