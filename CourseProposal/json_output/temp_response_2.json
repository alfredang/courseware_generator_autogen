        {
            "What are the performance gaps in the industry?": "A significant gap in the industry is the misalignment between technical requirements and the actual implementation of Kubernetes solutions. Many teams lack the ability to effectively coordinate the various components of their applications, leading to integration issues and suboptimal performance. Furthermore, there is often insufficient emphasis on coding standards and best practices, which can hinder scalability and reusability of solutions.",
            "Why do you think this WSQ course will address the training needs for the industry?": "The course emphasizes the importance of aligning technical and functional requirements within Kubernetes architectures, which directly addresses the misalignment issues faced by many organizations. By teaching participants how to articulate the value of their solutions and adhere to coding standards, the course fosters an environment where scalable and reusable applications can thrive."
