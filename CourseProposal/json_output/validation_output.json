      "What are the performance gaps in the industry?": "Many organizations struggle with efficiently managing and deploying applications at scale. Inconsistent application design and build processes lead to increased development times and higher operational costs. Furthermore, a lack of standardized frameworks often results in applications that are difficult to maintain and update, hindering agility.",
      "Why do you think this WSQ course will address the training needs for the industry?": "This course provides participants with the skills to establish robust structures for developing IT solutions, incorporating diverse processes and technologies. By learning to define, build, and modify container images and select appropriate workload resources, they can optimize application design and build processes. This structured approach enhances consistency, reduces development time, and improves maintainability, fostering greater efficiency."
    },
    {
      "What are the performance gaps in the industry?": "A significant challenge lies in aligning technical requirements with actual business needs. Many solutions are implemented without fully considering stakeholder requirements, resulting in misaligned architectures that fail to deliver the expected value. This disconnect often leads to costly rework and missed opportunities.",
      "Why do you think this WSQ course will address the training needs for the industry?": "The course emphasizes aligning requirements from various stakeholders, including internal and external parties, ensuring that the solutions meet technical, functional, and service demands. Participants will learn how to implement effective deployment strategies and utilize tools like Helm, which contributes to a smoother alignment process, resulting in solutions that are more relevant and impactful."
    },
    {
      "What are the performance gaps in the industry?": "The absence of comprehensive monitoring and testing processes often leads to undetected issues in solution architectures. This results in performance bottlenecks, security vulnerabilities, and increased downtime. A reactive approach to problem-solving hinders the ability to proactively address potential risks.",
      "Why do you think this WSQ course will address the training needs for the industry?": "This course addresses this by establishing processes for regularly monitoring, testing, and reviewing solution architecture against business requirements. Participants will gain skills in using built-in CLI tools, container logs, and debugging techniques within Kubernetes to proactively identify and resolve issues. This will allow them to ensure the ongoing health and alignment of the solution with business needs."
