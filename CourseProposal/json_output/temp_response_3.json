            "What are the performance gaps in the industry?": "A notable deficiency lies in the ability to thoroughly analyze security situations and apply prior experiences to new, evolving threats. Many professionals find it challenging to connect seemingly unrelated events to identify underlying risks. The ability to think critically and adapt to novel situations is crucial. Moreover, collaboration between security teams is often fragmented.",

It also fosters collaboration among security teams, ensuring comprehensive risk analysis, and facilitates effective communication, which ensures that different perspectives and expertise contribute to a more robust security framework. This can allow the teams to address complex risks and implement preventive strategies."
