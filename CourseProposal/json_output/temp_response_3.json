        {
            "What are the performance gaps in the industry?": "The absence of comprehensive monitoring and testing processes often leads to undetected issues in solution architectures. This results in performance bottlenecks, security vulnerabilities, and increased downtime. A reactive approach to problem-solving hinders the ability to proactively address potential risks.",
            "Why do you think this WSQ course will address the training needs for the industry?": "This course addresses this by establishing processes for regularly monitoring, testing, and reviewing solution architecture against business requirements. Participants will gain skills in using built-in CLI tools, container logs, and debugging techniques within Kubernetes to proactively identify and resolve issues. This will allow them to ensure the ongoing health and alignment of the solution with business needs."
